Welcome to *The Green Book (For Teachers, Instructors, Presenters, Students, and Learning Designers)*. Included is the license involved with this work and a chapter navigation if you'd rather go to a specific topic. This is a web-friendly version hosted on Github and created through Visual Studio Code. You do not need to access the main repository unless you want to.

**Last Updated: December 3, 2025**

### **Wait, a book hosted on GitHub?**

Yea! It's unconventional to host a book on this platform and I was against it at first and almost developed my own website instead.

Surprisingly, it has more benefits than expected:
- Version control capabilities
- Text styles
- Break points
- Supports Markdown
- Can be converted further from here
- You can copy over the material easily (with attribution!)
- It's self-published, so no middle man involved
- It's able to be free for the user/reader
