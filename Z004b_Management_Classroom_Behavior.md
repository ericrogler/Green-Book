# Classroom & Behavior Management

### [Previous Chapter](Z004ac_Management_Scaling_Macro_Micro.html)

## **Short Answer**

**The more people you have to manage, the more likely something can go wrong.**

**You can fix most (80-90%) classroom management issues with one action: limiting the size of classrooms/number of students each teacher manages.**
- Sadly, it often means more resources like real estate, staff, and wealth which may not be available.

A classroom management plan, and its rules, only matter when people at all levels of the organization, and to some extent customers/clients/users receiving the organization's services, enforce and follow them consistently (teachers, principals, staff, parents, etc.). It's a reality your plan may experience failure due to factors outside your control.

Discipline and management should be strict, but also fair and reasonable for everyone it affects. How you design and implement management plans also depends significantly on your intended audience.
- It's so significant I'd even recommend you find out about *who* you're managing/teaching first before developing a management plan and any rules/consequences. This applies outside of an education context too; it's not just for teachers/instructors.
  - E.g. teaching middle schoolers requires different techniques compared to teaching college students.

 To quickly sum up various stages of pedagogy (children/minors) and andragogy (adults) in learning and management:
- Ages 0-11: Favoring simple instructions, visualizations, cues, and routines over rules.
- Ages 12-14: Exploring autonomy, testing limits/rules, flexibility, and engaging content.
- Ages 15-18: Desiring respect, independence, and exposure to interesting content and better academics.
- Ages 18+: *Needing* independence, accountability, and content value for future careers.

You may also need licensure or certifications to teach specific subjects or do particular tasks legally, such as administering medicine to students.
- Also, never be alone in a room with two or fewer students without the door open.

Fair, well-designed procedures are necessary to manage classrooms and behaviors from day one. Without them, you spend more time managing instead of teaching. A "fun" or casual teacher that lets students essentially do what they want is a nightmare to deal with for other teachers, administrators, and substitute teachers covering for the "fun" teacher. Do *not* be that teacher.

**When people are not held to standards, they will not perform to standards.**
- This includes consequences for actions.

PBIS, or Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (rewards, restorative circles, etc.), has the letters "B" and "S" in it for a reason, despite being evidence-based. It shouldn't replace disciplining people and if there are no strict interventions and supports, there is no positive behavior due to a lack of consequences for actions.

## **Long Answer**

*Notice: This is its own dedicated "chapter" as there are myriad ways to establish classroom management and procedures. The chapter is also placed after the other Management chapters because concepts from there can directly translate to classroom and behavior management.*

If you told a typical manager they had 40 direct reports, they'd probably think you were crazy and start looking for another job now.

If you told a typical teacher/instructor they had 40 students (which are essentially their version of direct reports), they'd probably ask "total or per class" like it's another Tuesday.

What seems normal and reasonable everywhere else for management is not the case in an educational setting, but teachers and instructors are still expected to manage people. Classroom management is one of the hardest, if not THE hardest, problem teachers and instructors face. You may have affinity with a particular type of student, or students, or just be "good" across all disciplines; it varies a lot person-to-person.

Your management policies from the start of the year may change, or be more strict/lenient, by the end of the year as you adapt to the environment as well. You could also have people that are easy to "manage," but difficult to work with.
- E.g. Senior students (17-18 years) being easy to manage throughout the year, but losing motivation to do assignments near end of the year once they get the college acceptance letter.

Generally speaking, the older the students are the easier they are to teach. I know this may seem obvious, but if I don't write it down here someone will call it out.
- There *are* exceptions, yes, but I'm not covering them right now.

If you skipped the other management chapters and went straight to here, I'll recap some parts:
- Procedures and management strategies must scale up with more students under your supervision
- A 5 minute email can have the same, if not better, results than a 1 hour meeting
- Prepare for the worst, but assume the best of students
- All it takes is one disruptive, mismanaged student to ruin a classroom
- Time is your most valuable resource
- Success is determined by your ability as well as how well students perform
- Learning proper classroom management requires experience and application
  - A book, guide, etc. alone will NOT be enough to get you experience, *but it is better than nothing*

Also, depending on how many resources you have, or the type of educational facility you operate in, your "normal" school is your alternative school. This could happen from a refusal/blocker to removing a legitimate threat

*Alright, let's get into it.*

### **One Plan to Rule Them All**

Lord of the Rings reference aside, your ideal goal is one plan to handle every student. The *only* exceptions are students with legal documents, such as IEPs or 504s, where a change is mandated. 

In practice, while a better option is to design a plan to accommodate as many people as possible, there are cases you cannot do that and you may make minor edits to accommodate special education students.
- This may mean one plan for everything is infeasible. If that's true, the new goal is *minimizing* the number of different plans.
- One example in practice limiting a single plan may also be the sheer range of abilities and habits across students in a classroom, which means maybe only a small group get the full effect of learning at an appropriate level.

Ironically, while these accommodations may satisfy legal requirements, some cases, like emotional and behavioral deficiencies, pose a higher risk to classroom management and a general education student's learning experience while also affecting the available resources you have to effectively teach.
- E.g. a student may question why they have to follow your rules while another student gets to do "whatever they want," which gives the thought that they may not have to follow your rules as well.

Additionally, you don't need a plan to account for every minute detail, nor should you initially write a plan with every minute detail. You're making a plan that you can scale up easily, be adaptable (to a reasonable degree), and *can* be enforced and followed.

So what makes a classroom management plan a good plan anyways? I'll provide a compass and some examples below:
- It is objective and keeps subjective views and behaviors from students *and teachers* in line.
- It is reasonably strict, but also fair, enforceable, and consistent.
- It is appropriately designed for and understood by multiple people.
- It covers how to do things *and* how not to do things.
- It explicitly defines consequences for actions.
- It is considered important to follow.
- It can be taught.

Any good classroom management plan accomplishes one task exceptionally well: A simple, consistent, and fair way to manage a class. 

**Your management plan doesn't need to be too extensive nor does it have to answer *every* edge case initially.** It only needs to cover, at a minimum, what ensures a functional classroom setting. 

I've seen pages upons pages of rules in one scenario and I've seen an entire classroom management plan written on a single sheet of paper in 10 lines of text. Both did work well and both were appropriately designed for their classroom setting. Those same workplaces designed their plans to safely and effectively teach their specific classroom material and catered the procedures to their needs.

### **Going Beyond the Plan**

**A classroom management plan is only as good as the person (and by extension the system) enforcing it.**

Teachers may be at fault for undermining classroom management as well. Several examples of teacher fault are seen adapted from *The Classroom Management Secret: And 45 Other Keys to a Well-Behaved Class* (Linsin, 2013):
- Citing misconduct, but not applying consequences appropriate for the misconduct
- Yelling at students without due cause
- Extreme micromanagement
- Speaking too quickly so content cannot be processed
- Classroom management rules are neither demonstrated nor understood by students
- Dirty workplace or environment learning occurs in
- Not having a personality *of some kind* (i.e. being human)
- Enforcing a rule not currently a part of the classroom management plan or other legal entity's ruleset

These examples typically have one of two common themes:
1. Teachers/Instructors fail to follow their own plan
2. Teachers/Instructors don't project a human being; a relatable person

For the first item, it goes back to what I said earlier: if you won't enforce the plan, why have the plan in the first place?

For the second item, this goes squarely on the teacher or instructor (and in a later chapter on storytelling). If the teacher is ineffective, a student may question why they should invest attention into learning from *you*, the teacher, when they can just read the information online faster, ignore your teachings, and still meet your performance metrics.

Additionally, when enforcing rules and consequences, the goal is so the student is aware of the consequence and realize that it is their actions generating consequences, not the actions of another.
- In the case of groups of students, the group as a whole recognizing it is their fault.

### **Pavlovian Response ("Pavlov's Dog")**

*Alternatively: "Classical Conditioning"*

This research was done by Ivan Petrovich Pavlov in *Conditioned Reflexes* (paraphrased title) book (1927).

The experiment is taking a conditioned stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus to generate an unconditioned response. Translated into plain English, you generate a positive/negative effect accompanied with a trigger, such as a visual cue, specific sound, etc. When you notice this trigger, you're conditioned to expect a positive/negative effect.

I've done this before by using a stopwatch, starting it when I need to reign back in attention, and pausing it when attention is returned back to me. The result is an implied game of minimizing how much time is tracked on the stopwatch across all classes.

I've also seen other teachers do a hand gesture, held in the air, accompanied by a short phrase, and kept the hand up in the air until all other students mimicked the hand gesture to signal attention.

Do I say to do something similar? If it works, and doesn't cause moral/ethical/legal issues, then go for it I guess.

### **The Scaling Power of Wasted Time**

Let's say you do a morning activity that's short, gets student attention, and takes 1 minute per day. Each classroom session you host for a group of students is 50 minutes long across 180 days.

Repeating that same activity across all 180 days is effectively 3.5 days of classroom time spent *on that small, but repeated, activity.*

This doesn't come as a punishment or as a result of acting out. That's just from a routine check-in or activity you do to help run the classroom. It's a necessary cost to ensure things goes smoothly.

Now, let's say things don't go smoothly and you have a less-than-good group of students needing redirection every day because they're breaking rules or causing issues in a classroom.

To go off personal experience, I'd say this averaged out to around 3 minutes per day of redirection instead of instruction. Some days were almost perfect and some days were less than perfect.

That's now *nearly 11 days lost towards redirection.* That's 2 whole business weeks! For a small amount of time stopping issues from people who know they're not supposed to cause issues across the school period!

What may seem like a small loss adds up over time to the point it's a significant loss due to both mismanagement and people problems.
- Change minutes to milliseconds and you're on the way to spending 300 million USD (at 2009-2010 rates) for a cable reducing communication times from 16 milliseconds to 13 milliseconds (Budish et al., 2013).

### **Passes (to see other teachers/education staff)**

*Notice: This section applies specifically to high school and lower grade students.*

If a student is part of your class, and they need to see another teacher/staff member during you class, the general advice is to confirm through a phone call, email, text, or other method *from the other staff member/teacher* it is true. Said student is in *your* class, not the other person's class/office, so another teacher/staff member cannot normally excuse them from *your* class.

A student could lie to you here about where they need to go. They could also forge a pass as well to make their excuse seem legitimate If they do, it can become your problem the moment you buy into the lie/forgery. Get verifiable confirmation, even if not in doubt. Even with confirmation, you hold authority *in your own classroom* and can allow/deny permission to leave.
- Unless administration or an external third party forces a hand, then c'est la vie.

You could also say that leaving the classroom without a valid reason is grounds for a referral or other consequence, but that only works if you have a system willing and able to enforce it.

You could also be willing to let the students go into other classrooms or areas. You'll need a system to track where they are at and also ensure it doesn't infringe on what you need done and taught for your own class, or else you undermine yourself here.

Also, if you ever hear or use the phrase "If it's okay with your teacher" when it comes to issuing passes, please stop and do not tolerate it for several reasons:
1. I cannot recall, from personal experience, a single teacher actively OK with losing instructional time (especially when you're legally required to meet instructional time quotas!)
2. It makes a student think it's ok to disregard one class to catch up in another class.  
3. It implies the other teacher's class is not important, which is a sign of disrespect towards other professionals, and devalues the subject they're teaching as a career.

You should verify directly, with the other teacher(s), if it's ok or not in advance for writing passes to visit other teachers during a class period. Do NOT assume it is ok by default.

### **Are Suspensions Worth It?**

On one hand, you deny a student a structured learning environment temporarily.

On the other hand, you remove a disruptive element affecting the learning of every other student in the classroom.

From a pure benefit/cost standpoint, they are absolutely worth it. This is one case where the needs of many are more important than the needs of an individual, *especially* if your goal is to bring education to as many students as possible.

Nevertheless, ensure that issuing one adheres to any classroom rules and school rules established, or else it may be perceived as unfair and turn against you. You'd also want to avoid certain suspension types for behavior that is troublesome, but not violent and actively threatening other students. The suspension is also ineffective if it isn't something the student wants to avoid or the student doesn't care about the suspension anyway.

Students that are suspended once have a tendency, or at least higher probability, of causing issues when they get back into the classroom once again. They may not have kept up with school, which means not keeping up with your class. Because they're behind, they may disrupt the class again and the suspension process may repeat once again.

Many students who already do their work anyways, but cause issues, will likely do work while suspended anyways. If students wouldn't do work anyways, it's unlikely a suspension will suddenly change that habit.

On the other hand, research into suspensions, as well as short-term and long-term student removals from classrooms and schools, strongly asserts "exclusionary discipline practices have large negative impacts on adult crime and educational attainment" (Bacher-Hicks et al., 2019). Ideally, we focus on creating a safe and positive environment for learning to discourage bad behaviors rather than focusing on punishing bad behaviors when they appear.
- In the United States, these practices were addressed at the federal level by the [Obama Administration in 2014 (with revision in 2023 under Biden Administration)](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/guiding-principles.pdf) and visited by the [Trump Administration in 2018](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/documents/school-safety/school-safety-reportpdf.pdf).

### **How should I address student accommodations?**

It's no secret when students see their peers get something they don't, they'll question why that is the case, whether it is out loud or kept to themselves. Frankly speaking, there's no perfect answer that works in every scenario while also complying with confidentiality laws like HIPAA and FERPA. It's also difficult when the accommodation is clearly visible and actively in use in the presence of other students, because you, as the teacher, still likely cannot say anything breaking those laws.

Personally, I'd frontload it from day one or as soon as possible while going over classroom management. The intent of this method is to normalize differences rather than call attention to differences.

You don't need to say much here. Something like: "Some of you might have different tools or supports to assist you in this class. Your focus should be on your own work and I’m here to meet the needs of students trying to complete their work."

If it's an issue *after* something like the above is mentioned, then you can always recount back to the classroom management plan you set beforehand and went over with students. This allows you to firmly inform the student (assumingly) their role is on their own work you gave, not the work of others, and is therefore not a responsibility of theirs to decide how supports are managed.

### **How should I talk to students?**

It depends upon your audience. One group of students may favor one approach and another group of students may favor another approach. Nevertheless, the goal is to figure out what is, generally speaking, the "best" way to address students in general. Sometimes that is blunt, direct, and straight to the point like an Army Drill Sergeant. Other times that is 

Many points I'll make here are from me making a mistake in my own classroom and realizing "oh I should have done that" or from points I found elsewhere.

Remember that many teachers are dealing with and speaking to children. While some strategies communicating to adults can translate over, there are ways to specifically cater communication to children.

Let me introduce you to Fred Rogers, or "Mister Rogers," the host of Mister Roger's Neighborhood. There's several ways his style of communication is displayed or talked about, such as [his testimony before the Senate in 1969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKy7ljRr0AA).

**I'm not saying you need to be another Fred Rogers. There are also times where it's best *not* to talk exactly like Fred Rogers to your audience.** 

If you're starting down the road of teaching and instructing, be aware it may take years to learn how to communicate well before a return on investment occurs. Even Fred Rogers sought the advice of psychologists and child-development experts, like [Margaret McFarland](https://misterrogers.org/articles/margaret-mcfarland/), to inform his philosophy and how he communicated with his audience and children (Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, 2018).

Without quoting entire blocks of text here, here are some personal observations of his works:
1. A distinct lack of filler words, like Um, Uh, Ah, etc. He uses planned pauses and rarely, if ever, stutters.
2. A deliberate pacing of words in his speech.
3. Asks "how" or "what" instead of "why" more often.
4. Adopts a delicate, yet direct, way of addressing topics.
5. He never yells.

Simply put: if you don't know how to speak to children and/or don't know where to start, take a note from Fred Rogers and his proven success in public broadcasting.

### **What about allowing cell phones in the classroom?**

**Don't.** **For colleges and K-12 classrooms, the answer is a resounding *no*.** 

Even if it proves to be yet another logistical challenge to enforce, the benefits of not allowing cell phones far outweigh the costs. This answer still remains the same, in the future, if another type of technology replicates much, if not all, of the functionality of cell phones in 2025.

Three exceptions in my opinion:

1. People who confirmed potential emergencies may occur with the instructors beforehand and need a cell phone handy, but not in active use, to respond appropriately.
2. Students with verifiable legal or medical documents permitting the use of a cell phone for explicitly defined and specific purposes.
3. Your state, district, and/or school have a different policy to abide by regardless of your personal stance.

Keep in mind this is not saying to confiscate phones on sight. Only not to *use* them during designated times, like an active classroom period.

If [multiple blue and red states in the United States are limiting cell phones](https://apnews.com/article/schools-cellphone-bans-social-media-parents-d6464fbfdfae83189c752fe0c40fd060), new cell phone restrictions now signed in as law, and me telling you this doesn't already convince you, I'm not sure what will (Amy, 2025). Your principal or another legal authority giving you a consequence like a disciplinary action, written referral, or worse might convince you otherwise.

Even if it isn't a law in your area, there are thousands, if not tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands [according to Google Scholar when searching for "cell phones and academic performance"](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_sdt=0,6&q=cell+phones+and+academic+performance&hl=en), of studies and research done over the past 2 decades showcasing its negative effects in education (Google Scholar, 2025).

As for "what if" and other emergencies, like if a young student needs to have their phone for emergencies, considering the following points I present first:

- Modern cell phones can record audio and video. For protecting student privacy and complying with federal laws like FERPA and HIPAA, schools may establish policies to regulate these devices.
- As cell phone laws in educational settings become widespread, students carrying phones may be subject to these new regulations and face higher risk of violating them.
- Say a student has GPS tracking on their phone. All that does is record the position of their phone, not the position of the student. A phone may not accurately indicate the student’s location or safety. Verification of a student's safety and whereabouts typically requires contacting the office, an administrator, or another staff member in the facility.

There are other reasons why I'm against cell phones, but they delve more into opinions rather than statements I can keep reasonably objective.

I'd even argue school-provided technology like laptops and computers are just as detrimental, if not more detrimental, than phones. Since those particular techologies are deemed necessary in modern times for learning, the main solution (and often *only* solution) is to heavily restrict what can be done, viewed, and completed on that technology. You don't have to mimic George Orwell's *1984* here, but you need extreme safeguards against any potential distraction inside of any learning environment.

### **What about critical incidents and traumatic events?**

This section refers to cases like deaths of students/staff, shootings, extreme violence, terrorist attacks, and other crises.

You may have plans in place already, such as a crisis response or communication protocol. If so, follow any reporting, safety, and communication guidelines first, as well as complying with administrative direction, before taking personal action.

A teacher's role is managing how these events affect their curriculum and classroom. Other staff like counselors, psychologists, and therapists handle these events and the emotions involved behind them. The teacher's priority is providing a safe, supportive environment in the classroom and not therapy.

If I had autonomy to do so, I'd pause normal routines for 2 days to a week to let people process the incident(s). For example, if near the weekend, you could do Thursday/Friday as relaxed days with minimal work and use the weekend for additional time off. You can then attempt a restart/checkup the start of next week. 

Students may be OK following your classroom management procedures, but be mindful of triggers related to the incident(s). For some people, this may be the first time they grapple with the concept of mortality. While people are surprisingly resilient (or surprisingly good at masking feelings), they also need time to heal and process what's happened and what will happen from now on. 

These kind of incidents affect everyone differently, including you, so multiple options and accommodations will help instead of hinder.

Lastly, if you need personal time off, ensure you go through the proper channels. Also ensure the emergency substitute plans (or regular plans, if time permits) are available as students still need a teacher-of-record present.

### **What if students just don't give a #$%^?**

That's typically a worst case scenario and doesn't have a perfect fix for any individual instructor/teacher. If most of the class is at this point, this may also suggest a systemic problem outside of your control. In this situation, regular classwork is likely not getting done. 

If nothing else works, then focus on those who still want to be taught, help those who try, and document failures of those who don't care or try.

As for other suggestions, let's start with focusing on relationships. This is, however, a long-term solution and requires proper investment to work. I don't mean just listening to students, but also sharing *appropriate* things with them in turn. You're setting up a feedback loop to showcase enthusiasm in a class and hope it improves the situation. Sometimes it does work and sometimes it doesn't.
- If you show you care, it's harder for them to not want to care.
- You cannot care more than they're willing to learn, however.

Another suggestion is providing incentives like candy or free time. Be careful with this, as you may promote extrinsic motivations instead of intrinsic motivations.

Lastly, I'd look into your own content, and any interactions in the content, for altering the lessons themselves. It could be the presentation of the material, or the material itself, is what turns them off. It could also be there's too much passive learning over active learning.

Even the best learning methods don't do anything if they aren't properly utilized by students. If that's true, you'll want to look into how you convey content or engage students, such as switching to questions they have to engage with or trying to get them to teach each other.

I'll also emphasize once more to document how the class goes, just in case someone contests grades, results, or outcomes.

### **Handling Disruptive Students in a Classroom**

Ideally, administration or security removes them from the classroom despite multiple warnings and violations of classroom policy and school/facility rules.

Practically, you're trading off winning a battle for potentially losing the war. You may also be restricted by legal statute for how long you can punish a student for too.

Say a teacher sends a student to administration due to bad behavior. They can:
- A: Be absent for the rest of the period.
- B: Come back after an extended time to figure out what they missed
- C: Come straight back to your class and cause issues again, just to see if you'll punish them again.

A and B are more ideal situations, whereas C is a worse situation to be placed in.

Essentially, if the environment doesn't enforce disciplinary actions for bad behaviors, expect bad behaviors to occur. This environment includes administration, parents, other professionals responsible for discipline, and related roles.
- If systemic support doesn't work, any options for management moving forward are heavily limited.

### **What should I do for low-energy days without sacrificing class time?**

It's a common problem and there were definitely days I wanted to just sit in a comfy chair, but had to be in class.

The good news is there's some solutions and examples you can make to prepare as ready-made templates so they're easy to adjust and quick to implement.

Posters are relatively low cost on resources and promote active learning instead of passive learning. Plus, you can also make it an activity/project day.
- Prepare paper and coloring utensils (or pencils for greyscale).
- Pick any topic(s) you're going over in class.
- Have students create visuals to explain that topic.

Silent reading is another activity you can do, but it depends on your school. You may have to buy out a bunch of books to have on standby, and other times students may have an "assigned" book to go over throughout the school year.

If it's a STEM class, you could present a problem or model to discover and have students use a particular software, set of tools, or components to try and solve it. As they are using technology though, you may have to expend a bit more effort in managing and monitoring to ensure they're doing what you assigned.
- One project I found interesting was in a biomedical class where students designed a one-way heart valve. An assignment was given, I gave them one hint (how a door stays closed), and let them loose for the rest of the period.

These are only a few examples. There's plenty more out there ready to be searched for, created, or found.

### **What happens if a student catches me making a mistake?**

Admit you made one, thank them for catching it, and move on with the lesson.

People make mistakes and you should acknowledge that. No need to let ego get in the way here.

Exception may be if it's a mistake causing a full lesson interrupt. In that case, you may need to create an alternative assignment, activity, etc. to supplement the rest of the class period.

### **“Are we doing something today?”**

*Alternatively: "Did we do anything yesterday?" and "Is this graded?"*

You would be surprised how often this question comes up if you've never taught before. Keep in mind, in 2025 and beyond, there's a vast amount of technology specifically covering what students missed on previous sessions (and in some cases, cover in future sessions).

This is code for "do I have permission to not care about class today?" based on practical experience. Bluntly speaking, the student doesn't care and is disengaged.
- There is the *rare* exception it is actually genuine, but this exception is based more on a *"tell"* than anything else.

You can be kurt, funny, or deadpan with your response so long as it doesn't violate any rules/laws or get you fired. As long as your answer isn't "No" or "We are not doing anything today," it works because it helps maintain your sanity.
- This situation is one case where you're going to have to make your own fun to survive as a teacher/instructor.

Some of my favorite responses, even if some were *definitely* jokes, were:
- "Yes."
- "Science."
- (If absent before) "We held a funeral for you yesterday."
- (College) "Every class you ignore, take out 500 dollars from a bank account and burn it. That's how much each class you don't care about costs you."
- (Is this graded?) "For you, yes."
- (while surrounded by buildings) "Yea, we fought a bear here."
