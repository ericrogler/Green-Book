# Guest Teachers, Speakers, and Presenters

### [Previous Chapter](Z014_Assistant_Teachers.html)

## **Short Answer**
Guest teachers are any individual partially, or fully, replacing you in a teacher role temporarily. They could teach topics you may not have licensure, certification, or availability to do yourself, or anyone able to ensure students accounted for when you're unavailable.

Whether or not guest teachers are allowed is typically dependent on administrative approval, legal procedures, and background checks instead of only teacher approval.

## **Long Answer**
*Notice: This is not legal advice. It talks about things guest teachers typically need to go through before allowed to teach at a specific institution.*

Imagine this scenario. You are a music teacher and you are friends with a famous artist, band, or other notable figure. You contacted them, they agreed to come over, and you have a date and time. Seems all good so far!

Not necessarily.

### **Potential Blockers to Guest Teachers**

**Legal Eligibility and Background Checks**

Some laws restrict people with certain crimes around campuses. Ensure guests are allowed on campus and cleared before they visit. This may typically be handled by administration.

Additionally, extensive background checks aren't something you normally verify and conduct yourself. Federal authorities, principals, and other support staff do this for personnel in workplace settings. Some schools may have a verified adult list to allow select individuals to do extracurricular activities and/or a list to ban select individuals as well.

**Administrative Approval** 

Your principal or dean must approve the visit. If it's off-campus, it typically falls under field trip procedures and still requires their approval and acknowledgement to host.

**Written Agreements**

To mitigate ambiguity, create a written record of the session(s), and deal with any liabilities, you'll want a written contract and/or form with some of the following:
- Role(s)
- Duration
- Equipment needed
- Student interactions with teachers/guests
- Subject matter(s) taught
- Accommodations needed
- Monetary costs payable to guests, if any
- Additional rules, stipulations, and expectations

**Monetary Costs** 

Many guest teachers and presenters are adults and may request compensation for their work. If the payment(s) do not get handled, that may cause issues and cancel the guest teaching session. If they're volunteering or doing it for free, then you don't need to worry about this.

### **Got past all the checks! Now what?**

Once all approvals are complete, verify and ensure all roles are clearly defined and met. If, on the agreed times of the sesssion, you're unsure what your role is and you're present during the guest teacher session, then assume the following, at a minimum, are true until proven otherwise:
- You're present as the teacher of record and assume responsibility for the students
- You ensure students follow the rules and procedures
- You'll need to be around to handle emergencies and unforeseen liabilities/events
- You'll have to remain around the students

You may have standard procedures, or SOPs (standard operating procedures), pre-defined as well. If so, you may be safe to defer to those for all other things to do during guest teacher sessions. These sessions are similar to standard classrooms and partly what you normally do as a teacher anyway.

The guest teacher is also bound by any rules they agreed to as well. If they do not follow them, you may have to deal with removing them from the campus and even impose legal consequences upon them.

**If you want to get a guest teacher or presenter, it's OK to do–and sometimes encouraged–but make sure you have everything squared away before the time(s) they're present.**

### **Substitute Teachers**

Substitute teachers are teachers with either a teaching license or a substitute teaching license in your applicable state. For private schools, they could be vetted adults by administrative staff too (since private schools are classified as private businesses). 

Unlike other guest teachers, substitute teachers already establish formal job contracts with agencies or school districts, completed multiple background checks at state/federal level, fignerprints on file, and the blockers above are already taken care for you. Substitute teachers can temporarily, and legally, replace you as a primary teacher/teacher of record. In most cases, they are called upon a day before/morning of a given day, rather than planned far in advance, but some substitute teachers may take on long-term coverage.

With a substitute teacher, you may safely assume some things until proven otherwise:
1. They very likely do not know the same material as you.
2. They may not follow your instructions, even if explicitly written and detailed.
3. They will not have access to the same software you do (e.g. GoGuardian, laptop monitoring software, Google Classroom, etc.)
    - Sometimes it is the facility's rules and administration blocking access instead of any teacher(s).
4. They may handle classroom management differently from you.
5. They may not have the appropriate training to handle certain situations like the primary teacher can.

A substitute teacher can issue some punishments on your behalf for days they cover, provided they are permitted to do so by their contract's terms and administration's rules. However, how they can issue those punishments may be restricted. Some examples of what substitutes may be cleared to do regarding discipline:
- Minor and moderate infractions: documenting issues in substitute-to-teacher notes to be handled at a later time
- Physical issues: calling security
- Major infractions: calling office / administration

If you're the teacher and the substitute does send you notes, I'd say take any note, good or bad, with a grain of salt. You can follow up with one of your "good" students about how the day went, or verify with other staff about details, for anything you're suspect about. If it's confirmed a day did not go well, some things you may be permitted to do, unless administration blocks it, includes:
- Restricting recess time
- Forcing written apology letters from students
- Introducing a "quiet period" 
- Giving out zeros/reduced grades for assignments
- Quizzes over the material covered on substitute teacher day(s)
- A written conduct referral for specific student offenders
- Class-wide or specific student punishments
