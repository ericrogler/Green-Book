# Guest Teachers, Speakers, and Presenters

### [Previous Chapter](Z014_Assistant_Teachers.html)

## **Short Answer**
These are NOT substitute teachers; they're people who are not the primary teacher, scheduled and arranged to come in for a limited time to teach one or more topics to your students.

Suppose there's a topic you want to teach that you usually cannot teach due to licensure, certification, or disclosure agreements. In that case, you could have a guest, who is NOT a teacher, come in to teach or present.

Keep in mind that whether or not guests are allowed is dependent on administrative approval over teacher approval, as it involves many legal procedures.

## **Long Answer**
*Notice: This section deals mainly with education involving minors and younger students, rather than adult students. Adult students in tertiary education may have different procedures I'm not personally familiar with, so I will not speak on them in-depth. I'm also purposely going overboard on some requirements, so you can scale down as allowed.*

Imagine this scenario. You are a music teacher and you are friends with a famous artist, band, or other notable figure. For purely example purposes, let's go with Pink Floyd. I like Pink Floyd and their album The Dark Side of the Moon. They have a lot of credibility when it comes to musical ability, and the students get to meet a pretty famous band in person.

You contacted them, they agreed to come over, and you have a date and time. Seems all good so far!

Except, well, you'll still have blockers.

**First, can they legally be in the area you're teaching?** 

Some laws restrict people with specific crimes on their record from living, being near, or working in educational settings. If they fall under this category, you're extremely unlikely, if ever, to get them in the area legally.

**Secondly, have they passed verified background checks?** 

Background checks aren't something you will normally verify and conduct. Federal authorities, principals, and other support staff inside and outside of the school will do this for personnel in workplace settings. Some schools may have a verified adult list to allow select individuals to do extracurricular activities and/or a list to ban specific individuals as well.

**Thirdly, was it approved by your boss (i.e., the principal/dean/assistant principal)?** 

School settings are strict about who is allowed on campus, so unless they have the stamp of approval from the administration, they may not access the campus. 
- There is still a possibility of allowing the guest teacher session, but outside of campus. In this case, you'll need to worry about field trip procedures and likely require similar, if not more, permissions to go forward with the guest teacher experience.

**Fourthly, did you explicitly define the conditions IN WRITING (yes, get it in writing when possible) for the guest teacher**, such as: 
- How long they're teaching for with BOTH start and end dates
- Which part(s) of the campus are they using, if any
- What subject(s) are they teaching
- What equipment are they permitted to bring into the classroom, and/or what equipment are they NOT permitted to bring into the classroom
- What you, the teacher, will be doing or allowed to do during the guest teacher periods
- Any other stipulations and rules needed to ensure a smooth classroom experience
- What accommodations are needed, if any
- What check-in and check-out procedures are involved at the campus
- To what extent are they permitted to interact with students for activities 
- What happens if any rules are broken, and what are the consequences, if needed
- Monetary costs payable to the guest teacher, if any

**Fifthly, were there any monetary costs you need to cover?** 

Don't forget that many guest teachers and presenters are adults and very likely need money as compensation for their work. If you don't pay them the amount they ask for, then they won't do what you want them to do. Simple as that. If they're volunteering or doing it for free, then you don't need to worry about this.

**Got past all the checks! Now what?**

Even after meeting these blockers, you'll still have to make sure they also follow the rules defined and set by you and anyone else in the timeframe specified, or else you'll deal with removing them rather than keeping them in the classroom.

After all of the checks and procedures to make sure they're allowed in the classroom, it's similar to a standard classroom. It's them as the teacher and you doing whatever role(s) you've defined.

Suppose explicit roles weren't defined for you, the teacher, and the guest. In that case, I'd remain in the classroom and near the students. This standard procedure helps address any emergencies or concerns the guest teacher is unable or ill-equipped to handle. It also protects me, students, and the guest(s) in case of any unforeseen liabilities or situations we did not originally plan for.

**If you want to get a guest teacher or presenter, it's OK to do–and sometimes encouraged–but make sure you have all the legal stuff and background checks squared away before the time(s) they're present.**
