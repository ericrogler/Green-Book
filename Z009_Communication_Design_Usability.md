# Communication, Design, and Usability

### [Previous Chapter](./Z008_Source(s)_Of_Truth.html)

## Short Answer
Being a teacher also means being a designer. The materials you provide students are an extension of your teaching and communication with them. If you don't need to reinvent the wheel to teach your topic(s), then don't reinvent the wheel.

When in doubt, design for clarity and simplicity–even at the cost of some consistency. Designing goes for templates, assignments, tests, projects, activities, etc. The more clarity an assignment has, the more likely a student will do it with fewer issues.

**Some notable exceptions would be:**
- An assignment explicitly testing reading comprehension and analysis
- Research articles
- Practicing writing sentences (longer → shorter versions or in general)
- State testing and specialized testing
- This book

## Long Answer

**I want you to be aware of 2 things before continuing:**
1. There's a high chance someone else did what you want to do before you
2. There's also a high chance someone did something better than you before you

Reread those two things.

This isn't a means to dissuade you from creativity or teaching; it's a reality. Go ahead and do a Google search on any topic you want to do if you don't believe me.

Did a Google search and found your goal? Take a closer look, see how they did the topic, then guesstimate if you can do a better job than they did. What if you found something, but of poor quality, or you didn't find your topic? That's when you can flex your ability and creativity.

**If you don't need to reinvent the wheel to teach your topic(s), then don't reinvent the wheel.** Broken record reminder: time is your most valuable resource. 

If someone did something extremely well for a topic you're covering, it is OK to use that and apply it in your setting. It's valid and reasonable, in the interest of time, to stand upon the shoulders of giants. You can still cover that same topic if your approach is objectively better or increases accessibility.

Capitalizing on others is also a surprisingly common occurrence in businesses: one business may have a fantastic idea, but fail to capitalize on it correctly. Another business then comes across that same idea later. It executes it perfectly, making millions to billions of dollars in profit. You may not change the core facts surrounding the topic, but your timing and methods can improve.

You don't need to be the best at discovering or inventing ideas. Still, you do need to be good at selling/teaching ideas to prospective clients/students.

**Be mindful of a few things, though, when using others' work:**
- What you use aligns with the standards and objectives you need to follow.
- Using the appropriate attribution and following the content's licensing.
  - I did briefly mention the US Copyright Office in an earlier part. Still, there are other types of copyright (or "copyleft") as well, such as **[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/)** and **[MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit)**.
  - Normally, this is easily found, like in a License file, in a specific section of text, or on a separate page of a website. Other times, it requires in-depth searching.
- Understanding what you're using, reading, etc., when teaching from it.
  - This may seem obvious, but I do need to say it in an era where AI can generate an answer and people regurgitate it without critical thinking.
- You're able to utilize it as part of your curriculum, and the content does not face a blocker.
- You don't need to fix everything wrong with the borrowed content.
  - "Good enough" content done in a day is better than "perfect" content done in a month.
  - Focus on what's directly related to your standards and transferable first and foremost.

### **The User (Student) Experience**
Imagine you're using a website or playing a video game for the first time. You may not know how to use it to its full potential, or you're going in with some knowledge of conventions and standards about how this website or game should operate.

Students are much the same way. They're coming from multiple demographics, and each demographic shares some conventions in common, while others are less well known. 

It's an easy assumption to think students know how to navigate through the content like we do. In reality, that couldn't be farther from the truth. You may find your students–and maybe you–doing any of the following:
- Scanning text instead of reading text
- Settling on a reasonable first solution
- Stumbling through how something works

Does this mean they're wrong? Not necessarily; it means the material and work you're giving them is something they want to get through quickly.

You'll find students are going in with a goal in mind. That goal may be getting through the material as fast as possible. Another goal could be "What does X do?" In either case, they'll focus on that goal and tend to avoid materials that don't meet or satisfy their goal. To expand on what I mentioned earlier:
- If they want to get done quickly, they'll opt for scanning rather than reading instructions, figuring out the best solution, or just brute-forcing their way through.
- If they're figuring out how to perform a specific action, expect them to focus only on tasks that help them do that and potentially ignore everything else.

A misaligned goal is something you can mitigate to an extent. Any form of thinking takes up energy; if you can spend less energy thinking about something, then you'll likely do that. Your material could be the best and most fun in the world, but viewed as nothing more than work, which takes up time and energy that students would rather spend elsewhere. 

When in doubt, design your teaching materials so that they require as little thinking as possible. Conventional templates, multiple choice questions, and familiar formats may not look their best. Still, they require less mental effort to meet their goal and give back more time to do what they want. By extension, this means you get more time to have them focus on what you want them to learn; all by making it easier to meet their goal(s).

You can also teach new conventions and methods, but keep in mind that it may take students several iterations and exposures before they require less mental effort to think about how to do it.

### **The Pareto Principle**
You may have heard of the 80/20 rule before. That's what the Pareto Principle is. It's applied to many different scenarios and situations, but for a valid reason: 80% of the consequences come from 20% of the causes is a commonly observed event. It's a generally accepted rule (NOT law).

**There are some misconceptions to correct:**
- The Pareto Principle describes a commonly seen distribution of events.
  - E.g., 20% of people have 80% of all caulk. That same 20% of people also have a probability of owning any amount from 0% to 100% of all caulk.
- 80 + 20 =/= 100. 
  - It's possible 99% of people have 99% of something, which gives you a 99/99 distribution (or 99 + 99 = 198).
  - It's also possible 80% of people have 0% of something for an 80/0 distribution (80 + 0 = 80)
- It is related to a law (i.e., Law of Diminishing Returns) but is not a law itself.
- (Low Math Example) In a paragraph of 5 sentences, one sentence summarizes most of the paragraph.

How this applies to you as a teacher is this: focus first on the serious problems before tackling the not-so-serious issues. 

Don't know what the serious problems are? 
1. Make a list
2. Rate the items in order of significance
3. Make solutions 

Solutions don't have to be perfect; just good enough to effectively solve the problem.

### **Accessibility**
Outside of legal requirements like IEPs and 504s, you want to make sure your teaching material is accessible.

Does this mean more work? Yes. Does this also mean you can dramatically improve people's lives and experiences with slight effort? Also yes.

If you want two examples, think about blind and deaf people. Braille accommodates learning for blind people, whereas ASL (American Sign Language) accommodates deaf people. Because these demographics have these methods to communicate and learn, they're now on a similar stage of learning compared to peers without those disabilities.

You might also claim that accessibility will harm the design and content of whatever you're teaching. Outside of exceptional niche cases, that's not always true. I found that designing for accessibility won't compromise the design, look, feel, and delivery of a message. It significantly improved the curriculum and made things simpler to understand for all students. It also eliminated–or heavily mitigated–issues where students without disabilities likely encountered difficulties in one area, and students with disabilities experienced similar problems in the same area.
