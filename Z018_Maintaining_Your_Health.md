# Maintaining Your Health

### [Previous Chapter](Z017_Other_Additional_Duties.html)

## **Short Answer**

If possible, have a nice day.

You are allowed to quit/walk away and not have an opinion on everything.
- What consequences follow, though, is still your responsibility, but you can and may stop.

You are human, so you have human needs. For many, teaching is a job and not their life.

I view two ways to approach teaching and instruction: as a job and as a career.
- Job: you go in before contract hours, do your role to the best of your ability, then leave after contract hours. 
    - I.e., you leave work at work, take time off when needed, and invest in other passions.
- Career: teaching is a passion where you continuously improve and offer help outside work when able.

Both ways are valid. You can have amazing and passionate teachers and instructors with either perspective. One may switch between viewing teaching as a job vs career over time too. 

With either way, though, be careful not to get taken advantage of and know when to set boundaries.

## **Long Answer**

Many teachers are likely to work outside of their contract hours; the hours of the day you're "supposed" to be at a school performing duties. 

For first-year teachers, it's nearly inevitable because you're probably designing everything from scratch. If not going from scratch, then you're spending more time figuring out how the systems work. 

For more experienced teachers, the amount of time outside of work you get back gradually increases because you can do things faster and require less rigorous setup for your classes. You've had *years* to fine-tune everything and build up a pool of resources to quickly draw from.

Is it normal to work outside of contract/normal work hours? For most people, no.

Do teachers/instructors typically have to work outside normal work hours just to stay on track with their workload? Sadly, yes.

### **A list of things to consider**

Most of what's mentioned below are from things you may find, or deduce, from sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. They should be treated as general information references (full links are in the bibliography at the end). There's also teacher specific items as well. 

*For these reasons, do not interpret the following below as medical advice.*

- Get enough sleep.
- Protect and stay within contract hours when you can. If you go over, make it intentional.
    - If you need to volunteer for things, do not volunteer for too many things all at once.
- Make time, at least 4 hours (ideally 6-8 hours), for yourself and family each day.
- Make grading easy for you.
- Do not sacrifice health for work. Take time off if you're really sick.
- You will have good days and you will have bad days. Sometimes the bad days will ruin your entire day, and the best course of action is to try and focus on something else–outside of work–on that day.
- You may get sick more often because you're exposed to more germs and bacteria. In your shoes, I'd stay up to date with vaccines, reduce exposure to sick people, and sanitize/wash hands a lot.
- Exercise, even a little bit, will help keep you in moderate shape. Even walking is fine.
- Since COVID-19, masks are more normal and useful in high-risk health settings.
- Ensure you're meeting nutritional needs, such as vitamin and calorie intake.
- Manage stress.

If you're in a position where you also happen to be teaching basic health (not advanced health and medicine; leave that to health professionals like nurses, doctors, and dieticians), you can look into sources such as the CDC, NIH, and nutrition.gov as starting references, but have the same disclaimers about what type of source they are: information vs medical advice.

### **A Quick Life Lesson From An Unexpected Source**

There's an exchange between the characters Dr. Cox and J.D. from the TV show *Scrubs* in the episode "My Lunch" that sticks in my head more than I care to admit. [I'll link that scene in particular sourced from IMDB](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0796524/quotes/?item=qt5357194&ref_=ext_shr_lnk).

You shouldn't always be blaming yourself for your students' failure. Even with all the aid you provide to a student, that student may still fail, and there's a point where you're going to have to accept that. You've done your duty in the classroom, school, or learning environment, and that is your primary duty: properly teaching during your professional working hours. 

It may take less than a month, or a year, or even your entire teaching career before this happens. Still, there's always the chance it will happen to you, and you have to overcome that challenge or else have it eat away at you the rest of your life.

Your responsibility ends at doing your best within professional means and hours. Don't carry failures home like they're all yours. Hopefully me telling you this will help.

### **An Isolating Profession**

Another thing about being a teacher is it's an isolating profession. This may sound odd at first, because a teacher is interacting with many other human beings a lot. Still, many teachers are working alone most of the time.

In a teaching setting, your brain is processing multiple things at once:
- The content you're teaching
- How to explain the content to students to be best understood
- The possible dozen to 100+ social dynamics happening in the background, where any one of them can escalate into an issue
- Checking the entries and exits for any sudden visitors, which means potential interruptions to the class
- Scanning the room occasionally for emergencies which always have a low, but not zero, chance of happening.
- Maintaining a "high alert" state the entire class period, multiple hours at once, or even the entire day without pause or rest
- How to not undergo a sensory overload during the day

These occurrences aren't exclusive to teachers. High-stress, high-stakes roles such as firefighters, police, military, doctors, air traffic controllers, CEOs, and nurses may have similar experiences and situations, though across vastly different contexts, scenarios, and conflicts. Your actions may not affect whether someone lives or dies, but the environment you're in places a higher amount of stress than you may first expect.

It's like your brain is at 90-95% active utilization and 5-10% downtime at any given time on a workday. What this lack of downtime means is you may suppress many emotions because you don't have time to process them. When a break does occur, you may want to vent out and decompress as soon as possible. Even then, your current location at work may not be ideal for decompressing, so you might wait for a later opportunity again, likely at the end of the day when you're back home from work.

Venting and decompressing vary among individuals. It can be done through body language, verbally venting frustrations, relaxing peacefully, or any combination of these three and more. Maybe it takes 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or even an hour before you mentally reach a "normal" state and de-escalate from a "high alert" state.

**Keep in mind, these mental states and decompression processes are surprisingly normal.** Be mindful that your decompression or venting doesn't negatively harm or abuse other human beings, their property, and yourself. If it reaches that point or feels it's reaching that point, that's when it's gone too far, and you'll want professional help (e.g., therapists, doctors, etc.) to get through those hardships.
