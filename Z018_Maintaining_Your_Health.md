## **Short Answer**

You are human, so you have human needs you also need to fill. Leave work at work whenever you can.

## **Long Answer**

Many teachers are likely to work outside of their contract hours; the hours of the day you’re “supposed” to be at a school performing duties. For first year teachers, it’s nearly inevitable because you’re designing everything from scratch. If not going from scratch, then you’re spending more time figuring out how the systems work. For more experienced teachers, the amount of time outside of work you get back gradually increases because you can do things faster and require less rigorous setup for your classes; you’ve had *years* to fine tune everything.

### A list of things to consider

Here are things to watch out I’ve personally had to be mindful of. Some parts are repeats of what I said before, but if I’m repeating it, *it’s for a good reason*:

- Get enough sleep.
- Whenever possible, do NOT work outside of your contracted hours.
    - If you need to volunteer for things, do not volunteer for too many things all at once.
- If you can get around a third to a fourth (6 to 8 hours) of time to yourself–and family, if you have one–each day, that would be ideal.
    - Your hours are about 8 hours each day, and potentially up to 1 to 2 hours of travel each working day.
- Make grading easy for you and automate it if you can.
- There’s times taking 1 hour to work on something, then a small 5 minute break, gets it done faster than spending 2 hours continuously working on it.
- Do NOT sacrifice your health for a job. If it is dangerous to do, avoid it if able.
- You will have good days and you will have bad days. Sometimes the bad days will ruin your entire day and the best course of action is to try and focus on something else–outside of work–on that day.
- Chances are, your first year in a teaching environment you’ll get sick because you’ll be exposed to more germs and bacteria as usual.
    - Stay up to date with shots & vaccines.
    - Reduce exposure when you can.
    - Wash hands before leaving the workplace.
    - Have hand sanitizer somewhere within the room or area you’re working in. Don’t always use it though; sometimes hot water + soap works better.
    - Have a FAK (First Aid Kit) handy in case of minor emergencies.
    - Keep disinfectant/sanitising wipes in the area you’re working in as well.
- Exercise, even a little bit, will help keep you in moderate shape. Even walking is fine.
- Since COVID, wearing a mask won’t be seen as weird as it was in the past and you can use it if you’re in higher risk health environments. If there’s multiple students coughing, then definitely wear a mask even in normal environments.
- Ensure you’re meeting nutritional needs, such as vitamin and calorie intake.
- Manage stress.

If you’re in a position where you also happen to be teaching basic health (not advanced health and medicine; leave that to health professionals like nurses, doctors, and dieticians), you can look into sources such as the CDC, NIH, and nutrition.gov as starting references.

### A Quick Life Lesson From An Unexpected Source

There's an exchange between Dr. Cox and J.D. from the TV show *Scrubs* in the episode “My Lunch” that sticks in my head more than I care to admit. 

I'll post the entire exchange below; **[transcript sourced from IMDB](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0796524/quotes/?item=qt5357194&ref_=ext_shr_lnk)**.

*(Transcript Start)*

> J.D.: You know what I was thinking the whole time I was having lunch with Jill?

> Dr. Cox: What's that?

> J.D.: "God, this girl's annoying."

> Dr. Cox: I saw her in that supermarket, too, but I'm not torturing myself. Would you like to know why?

> J.D.: Why?

> Dr. Cox: Because she didn't come to the hospital looking for help. We just randomly bumped into her out here in the world. Don't get me wrong, if a guy gets shot or if he has a heart attack and I am physically the closest doctor to him, I will intervene. Shy of that, you can't. You just can't. It's too much to ask of yourself.

> J.D.: [half-heartedly] Okay. I hear you.

> Dr. Cox: No. You don't. Once you start blaming yourself for deaths that aren't your fault, my friend, that's a slippery slope that you can't come back from. And trust me, I've seen it ruin a hell of a lot of good doctors. And I will not let it happen to you.

> J.D.: [narration] And because he said that... I knew it wouldn't.

*(Transcript End)*

Fortunately, as teachers, you don't have to worry about causing deaths unless you're in a field where that is a real possibility. 

Instead I want you to take a moment to consider that scene in a teaching context. Two things to change:
1. Replace deaths with failing/failure, patients with students, and doctors with teachers. 
2. Replace “gets shot” and heart attack with a desire to learn. 

You shouldn't be always blaming yourself for your students' failure. Even with all the aid you provide to a student, that student may still fail and there's a point where you're going to have to accept that. You’ve done your duty in the classroom, school, or learning environment and that is your primary duty; properly teaching during your professional working hours. 

It may take less than a month, or a year, or even your entire teaching career before this happens, but there's always the chance it will happen to you and you have to overcome that challenge or else have it eat away at you the rest of your life.

Like the scene above, now that I told you about it, hopefully you don't get affected by it as much.

### An Isolating Profession

Another thing about being a teacher is it's an isolating profession. This sounds odd at first, because a teacher is interacting with many other human beings a lot, but many teachers are working alone most the time.

In a teaching setting, your brain is processing multiple things at once:
- The content you're teaching
-  How to explain the content to students to be best understood
- The possible dozen to 100+ social dynamics happening in the background where any one of them can escalate into an issue
- Checking the entries and exits for any sudden visitors–which means potential interruptions to the class
- Scanning the room occasionally for emergencies which have an ever present chance to occur; exponentially compounded as student count increases
- Maintaining a “high alert” state the entire class period, multiple hours at once, or even the entire day without pause or rest
- How to not undergo a sensory overload during the day

These occurrences aren't exclusive to teachers. High stress, high stakes roles such as firefighters, police, military, doctors, air traffic controllers, CEOs, and nurses may have similar experiences and situations, though across vastly different contexts, scenarios, and conflicts. Your actions may not affect whether someone lives or dies, but the environment you're in places a higher amount of stress than you may first expect.

To break it down mathematically, your brain is usually at 90-95% active utilization and 5-10% downtime at any given time on a work day. What this lack of downtime means is you’ll want to bottle up a lot of emotions and suppress them, because you often don't have the luxury to sort them out midway with a break. When a break does occur, you'll likely want to vent out and decompress as soon as possible. Even then, your current location at work may not be appropriate to decompress, so you'll have to wait for a later opportunity again; likely at the end of day when back home from work.

Venting and decompressing varies across different people. It can be done through body language, verbally venting frustrations, relaxing peacefully, or any combination of these three and more. Maybe it takes 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or even an hour before you mentally reach a “normal” state and de-escalate from a “high alert” state.

**Keep in mind these mental states and decompression processes are surprisingly normal.** I myself have gone through situations like these. Despite saying that, be mindful that your decompression or venting doesn't negatively harm or abuse other human beings, their property, and yourself. If it reaches that point or feels it's reaching that point, that's when it's gone too far and you’ll want professional help (e.g. therapists, doctors, etc ) getting through those hardships.
