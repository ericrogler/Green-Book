# General Management (for Teaching)

### [Previous Chapter](Z003_Legality.html)

## **Short Answer**

**God Entity, Futurama (2002)**
> "When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all." 
- Ironically, in practice, sometimes being visible is what gets you noticed and promoted while not being visible may get you in trouble.

*Notice: Though this chapter talks about management in the context of teaching and instruction, some information can also apply to associates, employees, peers, and more across various industries.*

**The ultimate goal is managing time/deadlines, cost, scope/requirements, and quality.** Soft skills, like communicating with people, and hard skills, like technical knowledge, are means you shouldn't neglect to best meet that goal. If you're not sure how to set up a process or workflow, start with the minimum (or simplest) that works. This could be sticky notes on a wall, a word document, or spreadsheet. Advocating for complicated processes when they aren't needed often goes against your goals.

**Do not ever neglect technical skills, even if you're in a management role now or in the future.** This also applies for managers in multiple industries, like programming and software, and also applies to teachers/instructors. You may be able to manage people well as a teacher, but your curriculum's content suffers if you don't know how to effectively teach.

**Prepare for the worst, but assume the best of people.**

Cooking something at 1200 degrees for 1 hour does *not* produce the same result as cooking something at 300 degrees for 4 hours.
- I have to say this is a joke, but if you apply this thinking broadly across multiple scenarios, you *will* have a bad time.

Lastly, most management "training" is going to happen on the job. As much as you'd like to be the manager that says "just get your work done and I'm good" that's rarely, if ever, going to be the case in practice and you'll still have accountability and autonomy issues.

## **Long Answer**

Teaching is either extremely hands-off (many online "courses" avoid interfacing with students almost entirely) or extremely hands-on. It can also be anywhere between those two extremes, but management exists across the entire spectrum.

Students range from a variety of backgrounds across multiple demographics. What may work for one student may not work for another, and how a student behaves in class varies from student to student. Some students may also respect the authority of a teacher and be respectful to other students. Some students will actively undermine the education of their peers, interrupt you when an opportunity arises, or even resort to physical contact.

This is a reality of the environment many teachers and instructors deal with on a daily, if not hourly, basis in a classroom setting. You have to manage people.

**You still need to plan for the worst-case scenarios.**

If you can figure out how to handle students at their worst, then you can handle them at every other degree of behavior. 

If a manager, or someone who manages, consistently encounters the same problem(s) over and over, then that manager is likely the problem.

### **Is Teaching (and Instruction) Hard?**

*Be advised this is heavily opinionated compared to other sections.*

It depends! 

For a catch-all answer: every role and its difficulties depends on the person in the role, the role itself, and the environment the role operates in.

In terms of environment, I'll look at the *2024-25 Discipline and Behavior Data Release Summary* from Colorado Department of Education (2025). Keep in mind any numbers in the list below also come from this same source.
- Compared to previous year's data, there's a 2% decrease in disciplinary actions.
    - Do note there's also ~2% less students present (65791 -> 64538) in the same survey.
    - Majority of issues result in suspensions given to student.
- Most disciplinary actions (~80%) are results from detrimental behavior, conduct violations, and disobedience/repeated interference.
- Drugs and alcohol account for 10% of violations.
- There's on average 2 disciplinary actions per student (132892 DAs vs 64538 students).

By these metrics, I have high confidence you *will* deal with troublemakers during any year of teaching. It's possible one student, or multiple, can cause significant issues every single day of teaching. 

Additionally, disciplinary actions recorded above do NOT include redirection, warnings, etc. that happened before the action is issued, as well as any time lost during instruction due to behaviors. This can potentially mean at least 2 things requiring further investigation:
1. Disciplinary actions being down doesn't necessarily correlate with improved behaviors
2. New systems implemented may affect how disciplinary actions are tracked to show things improved *only at the surface level.*

In terms of the teaching role itself, from what I've seen and experienced in addition to [what I read from RAND](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA1100/RRA1108-12/RAND_RRA1108-12.pdf) (Doan, Steiner, & Pandey, 2024) and the [School Pulse Panel](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/spp/results.asp) (2025), I'd probably give you this ordered list in overall difficulty:
- Special Education
- Alternative/Disciplinary Education
    - Some overlap with special education or behavioral intervention
- Traditional/General Education
- Online/Virtual
- Tutoring
- Corporate Training & Adult Learning
    - EdTech instructional roles, like online teachers and facilitators, are included here

This ranking comes from many areas and metrics like:
- Pay and benefits compared to hours worked
- The type of people taught (1v1, large groups, special needs, etc.)
- Bureaucracy and legality involved
- How often you're expected to work "outside contract hours"
- Pressure from external sources, like administration, parents, clients, etc.
- How much time is available to perform work in the roles
- How they're treated by society at large
- Amount of stress in general
- How often the work environment and initiatives change
- Difficulties and/or lack of consequences with the students being taught
- The level of support available and/or provided
- The methods used to deliver content effectively and efficiently
    - E.g. [Online vs face-to-face teaching from CITE Journal](https://citejournal.org/volume-4/issue-2-04/general/a-comparison-of-online-and-face-to-face-instruction-in-an-undergraduate-foundations-of-american-education-course) (Stern, 2004)

Teaching is not a role one can easily get into and excel at. This is even with the benefit of summers off (which is closer to unpaid downtime vs a vacation). Even people in highly technical roles may fail due to lacking proper pedagogy (for adults, andragogy) to teach *and manage* students effectively.

*Alright, opinionated piece over and back to normal content below.*

### **What does a Manager do?**

Manage resources.
- Resources includes people too.

That's the simple, pragmatic answer. What they actually do is handle communication and relationships between people, task delegation, creating schedules, and accomplishing a specific goal or completing a project/work.

Here's examples of what I mean:
- Finding new projects and work to keep everyone in business and employed
- Setting examples for people to follow
- Ensuring you don't exceed budget
- Hiring people and retaining people in the company
- Facilitating growth and mentorship of people
- Firing people who cannot meet performance expectations
- Reporting to leadership above, and sometimes reports below or at the same level, about progress and results
- Working with team and external elements, like stakeholders, to learn requirements and what work should be done
- Eliminating blockers for direct reports
- Securing resources to meet project goals
- Distributing workloads across employees
- Keeping a baseline familiarity with other departments to stay ahead of the curve
- Staying up to date with what their direct reports do
- Managing relationships between multiple teams, departments, people, and more
- Setting up effective and efficient meetings and schedules
- Understanding how to do the actual work of their team to better delegate work and explain technical topics to assist more customers
- Ensuring everything is done legally

There's a lot of tasks here. It's counterintuitive to micromanage people because it means hyperfixating on one element at the potential detriment of every other element.

### **Everyday Management Rules**

There are rules you should follow with every management style:

- **It must be legal for you to do.**
- Human behavior is surprisingly diverse, which means racing to conclusions may harm more than help.
- No means no. If you do not allow something, you MUST be willing and able to enforce that. The moment you do not, it becomes a rule that students, adults, and minors know can be broken.
- Appropriate punishments for appropriate behaviors. For example, a student talking out of turn can be resolved with a warning. That same student actively bullying another cannot be solved the same way and requires escalation.
- Ignore any attention-seeking behavior, as not every quip or comment a student makes is worth your time or even a reply.
- A management style you're comfortable with is a management style you'll enforce and follow more easily.
- Determine where "the line" is and do not move it unless necessary. Regardless of age, if someone can get away with something, they will try to do it.
- People listen to the advice of someone who knows what they're talking about more readily than someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. If you lose the perception that you understand what you're talking about, you also lose respect and weaken the ability to teach properly to students (or a group/audience in general).
- You're the filter and translator for requirements and what needs to be done for direct reports; the people in your team.
- Clear and decisive action solves issues faster than delaying and festering.
- When handling underperformers, it helps the rest of the team, class, etc. to address the issue(s) sooner rather than later.

**Many rules that work with one group of students/people may not translate over to another group of students/people.** Teachers across grades and school types operate in different teaching, management, development, and accommodation contexts, which means adapting your rules to fit these contexts is necessary.
- Example 1: A Kindergarten teacher and a 12th grade teacher may share some classroom management rules and procedures, but how they're best executed, written, and taught vary significantly enough it's like handling two completely different groups.
- Example 2: Accounting for differences in culture, resources, and student behavior between Title 1 schools and affluent schools require different types of rules, rule enforcements, and accommodations for learning.

### **Enforcing Control**

Success varies greatly depending on what type of group you're teaching. Still, some strategies are universal and applicable at various degrees of success with groups.

One single list will not solve all your problems. You'll need to adjust strategies over time, and this is something you have to do in practice rather than just reading about it. Other times, you don't have time to review the entire list mentally and may have less than a few seconds to get back control before chaos occurs.

**Here are some examples to enforce control of the room:**

- Establish a routine. If students know what to do without constant reminders, they're less likely to go out of turn.
- Clearly define the rules. Explicitly stated rules are followed and enforced better than implied rules.
- Shouting matches don't work. The first one to shout loses, so don't be the first one to shout.
- Remain calm.
- Determine where "the line" is and do not move it unless necessary.
- Do not carelessly give away rewards for good behavior, as they can be detrimental to intrinsic motivation by replacing it with extrinsic motivation.
- Be prepared to have a reason for why something is done the way it is. If it's because "you said so," it's not something you should do.
- Even if restricted by what you may teach, getting students to choose what they want to learn may increase their desire to learn and motivation to do well. (similar topic: "stakeholder buy-in")
- Calling out a student directly is more effective than simply stating "stop causing trouble" without calling out the person causing the trouble.
- Use statements over orders. Short and precise is best. "Fix it, please." "Do [thing], please."
    - If a statement is over 10 seconds long, it's too long. You can shorten it.
- Establish ways to set rapport. You don't need to be–or should be–their friends, but you do need to earn their respect.
- Be ready to "pull the trigger" when disciplining.
- Decide where and how you want people to sit, stand, or otherwise in a classroom, whether by strict assignment or casually (i.e., "just sit in a chair")
    - For online teaching, decide what they need to set up on their computer, phone, etc. to receive information and do tasks you assign appropriately.
- **Regulate the use of AI by students when possible (more on that later).**

### **Attention Economy**

The amount of time a student can focus depends on many factors, such as age, disposition, and personality. 

Generally speaking, the younger students are, the less time they can maintain focus before needing a break. A common rule of thumb is that a younger student's *maximum* attention span is 2 to 3 times their age (e.g., 13 years old = 26-39 minutes) before a short break is needed. The [**Pomodoro technique**](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) (Cirillo, n.d.) is one example of a management method capitalizing on attention spans.

Since 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a proliferation of short-form content, like TikTok videos and YouTube shorts. Due to their implementation of highly optimized psychological techniques to get your time, which are also found in similar apps and software, maintaining focus in a classroom is set to Hard mode by default. It's not impossible, but you're starting at a hefty disadvantage. In worse cases, allowing access to these applications in a school environment has a direct and significant effect on lowering grades and performance (Rozati, 2025). 

If a student wants to learn something, they'll at least try to learn something–which may not be what you're teaching. It's not always the case of the student intentionally doing something bad. Still, something else caught their attention more at the time, or they got confused about something and are now acting out.

**Fighting for attention can be remedied with some of these techniques.** They may not work perfectly and their effects vary, but it's significantly better than *not* using any of them.

- Keep an overall level of focus (look up "utilization rate") at 85% to 90%.
    - Some mental wandering, breaks, and loss of focus among students should be expected and accounted for.
    - Multiple study techniques are designed with breaks, so learning and teaching techniques should incorporate breaks too.
- Do not carelessly give away rewards for good behavior, as they can be detrimental to intrinsic motivation by replacing it with extrinsic motivation.
    - This means less interest in whatever you're trying to teach, as their goal is now the reward and not the knowledge you're imparting.
- Plan for potential breaks during classroom sessions.
    - For example, a 45-minute lecture can turn into 2, 20-minute parts with a few minutes break midway for a significant boost in retention, attention, and learning.
    - Just because a student *can* maintain focus for 50 minutes doesn't necessarily mean they always *should* do that every class.
- Get creative and use visuals to supplement material you're trying to teach.
    - Images tend to be far more pleasant to look at than large bodies of text. They are easier to digest information from when appropriately created.
- For presentations and lectures taught with a presentation screen of some sort, limit it to <= 50 words on a screen at a time.
    - **If you have to present more than that amount of words at once, prepare a means to highlight, underline, or accentuate parts you want to call attention to.**

### **Idle Workers vs Idle Work**

Some people may see people sitting around, doing nothing, and wondering why they aren't working. If someone saw someone not working, but hired them specifically to do work, they may think that work is not properly utilized and assign more work as a result.
- It's why "if you have time to lean, you have time to clean" may bring back traumatic memories for some readers.

What happens if someone is 100% busy, however, is they're unavailable for other work if it comes their way. Say a new issue arises the person needs to work on, but they're currently swamped with other, higher priority work.

That new issue sits and remains unaddressed, which forms a new kind of waste. 

*This* is idle work.

You can afford workers having some idle time, but you cannot afford workers unable to address idle work. If work gets delayed, you incur the cost of that delay. The problem isn't idle work; it's lacking capacity to complete work or not having workers *idle* to assign to it.

If you think idle workers are bad compared to idle work, consider a game of baseball or a relay race in track. You have multiple people, part of a team, where part of their workload is literally standing around in an assigned location. While they aren't actively *doing* something, they're preparing for, or are prepared, for an important task to come. In the case of baseball, this is when a player out in the field needs to run after and catch a ball to get the batter out or to help stop runners. In the case of relay races, this is a player getting ready to perform when their turn arrives and ensure the next person in the relay gets to their turn faster.

Keeping players, employees, workers, and people not 100% busy opens them up to do work as it arrives and complete their goals. Keeping them 100% busy, however, exponentially increases the backlog of things they need to do, but cannot do so without significant issues and pushes back the finish line further and further.

To remove idle work, you remove bottlenecks or things prevent work from getting done. That's what you should do when you're managing; removing obstacles and ensuring capacity/availability to do the work that matters when it arrives.

### **The Art of Meet[ings]**

A lot of people hate meetings. They hate meetings so much there's ways to mathematically show the cost of meetings.

**The lesson is simple: if you don't generate value greater than the cost of a meeting, do not host a meeting.**

The typical formula goes like this:

Meeting Cost = [Average Salary (currency/hour) x Employee Count (people) x (Duration (in hours) + Setup time (in hours)) + Additional Costs] x Occurrences (per unit of time)

As for some conversions:
- Average Salary (Annual) = Hours * 2080
- Average Salary (Monthly) = Hours * ~173
- Average Salary (Weekly) = Hours * 40
- Meeting Duration (Minutes) = Hours * 60
- Occurrences (Daily) = (2080/8) = 260 (or 262)
    - This assumes 40 hour work weeks for each week of a year, no vacation, with weekends off.
- Occurrences (Weekly) = 52
- Occurrences (Monthly) = 12
- Occurrences (Yearly) = 1

Simplified into variables, this is:

M = [A x E x (D+S) + Ac] x O

Say, for example, you have a 1 hour meeting with a team of 5 high-salary engineers and their average salary combined is 200,000 USD. You didn't need time to set it up in advance either.

M = (200,000 / 2080) x 5 x 1 = ~480 USD

That's just for one meeting.

Let's say you decide to implement Agile/Scrum daily standups for 10 minutes every workday instead of a 1 hour meeting for the year with your 5 team staff from before.

M = [(200,000 / 2080) x 5 x (10/60)] x 260 = ~20800 USD
- (10/60) = 10 minutes divided by 60 minutes in 1 hour

What about if you need to do daily standups, but it's for 5 employees with lower salaries around 50,000 USD?

M = [(50,000 / 2080) x 5 x (10/60)] x 260 = ~5208 USD

All these calculations also assume you don't need additional setup time, purchasing venue space, buying materials, and other additional costs for specific meetings as well; only personnel showing up for X amount of time.

Though meetings may seem like low-cost methods of communication, they quickly add up if not controlled. Even if you're in the camp of championing collaboration and "quick meetings," you still have to prove the value of a meeting is greater than the cost of doing one. This is *especially* true for meetings taking away time spent on other essential work projects.

### **Making Meet[ings] Simple, Effective, and Efficient**

There's multiple ways to do this.

If you need to make a decision *now,* one of the fastest ways is allowing people to vote more than once. For example, you have 5 options people can choose from, but only the most popular option is selected. You don't need an agenda, timekeeper, scrum master, other random person, etc. to manage it. You go around, ask yes/no questions for each option, tally votes, and pick the option with the most votes.
- If done right, this takes less than a minute.
- Don't use this method for critical or life-safe items.

There's also blocking out meetings on schedules for 1:1 meetings or meetings with multiple people at once. You can block out 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc. Even if there's time blocked out, you want to *minimize* how long the meeting lasts. Though these statements may sound conflicting, it's in your best interest to convey critical information quickly and clearly to reduce waste, stay on schedule/budget, and ensure people can do what they need to do.

For most meetings, you'll want an agenda of what to cover. This could be an essay or a short, bullet point list; the format the agenda takes doesn't ncessarily matter here. 
- If it needs to be shared, then it does matter because you'll want the agenda in written form.

The agenda is like a compass pointing you towards the direction of topics you need to focus on and communicate with everyone present. It's goal is to discourage bringing up unncessary things in the moment or sidetracking and wasting time. 

What this means is hosting a meeting without an agenda is a recipe for wasted time, effort, and money. Don't do it. Send an email instead like a normal person.
- There is one notable example that breaks this rule: a dial-in/coffee meeting or "happy hour."
    - Manager sets up available times, in advance, employees can come in to vent, discuss ideas, or talk casually.
    - They MUST be optional to attend.

### **Positive and Negative Student Behaviors**

*This usually applies to younger students, but older and adult learners can have behavior issues too.* 

Two categories I'll put behaviors in are positive and negative.

Every student wants to be understood and accepted, but each student has different ways of getting that acknowledgement. Negative behaviors can be replacements for a lack of attention or acknowledgement for many people.

Positive behaviors are behaviors you want to enforce and reward, such as giving attention to, providing *random* acknowledgements, and compliments. These behaviors vary across teachers, but generally, they are things you want students to do and how you want them to act. For behaviors you want to see, you provide a clear path to reach them and indications that they are reaching positive behaviors along the way to the goal.

Negative behaviors are any behaviors that put you, the classroom, or other students at a disadvantage and threaten the sanctity of the learning environment. Whenever a negative attention-seeking behavior occurs from a student, I prefer three ways to handle it.

1. Shut it down immediately.
    - All it takes is a few seconds for control to be lost, your authority diminished, and the rest of the class/audience to see an opportunity to make it worse.
    - Best when, you know with certainty, something goes against the rules of the school/classroom, etc.
2. Let it play out for a bit before deciding whether to ignore or act.
    - Mistakes are likely in the first 5-10 seconds; a delay may put out a fire and not add to it. 
    - While this carries some risk and can escalate a situation, it can also provide context to the negative behavior, let you collect evidence, and inform how you should handle it in the future.
3. Make it boring.
    - Usually only works for memes or trends going amongst students at the time.
    - The idea is that something an older person, like an adult, may participate in becomes something a younger student does not wants to be part of anymore or becomes uncool.

I'll talk more about these when I reach learning methodologies, but these negative behaviors require stern management. Negative behaviors tend to have these traits in common:

- Acquiring social attention
- May start mild and innocent, but devolve into something worse
- A reason behind the negative behavior

If a student shows signs of one of the following, or something related, do not feed into the attention they're seeking, or it will spiral out of control:

- Overly dramatic reactions
- Dramatic or provocative behavior
- Fishing for compliments
- Excessive noise-making
- Pushing boundaries
- Bullying others in the classroom
- Talking out of turn

Even if you mitigate negative behaviors, it doesn't always mean they're gone entirely. There is a reason behind the negative behavior. It is up to you to figure it out and see if a feasible solution exists, or else the negative behavior will repeat. These negative behaviors also occur outside of a school setting and aren't limited to students; your fellow staff, other adults, and children may also show them.

Negative behaviors will rarely resolve in a single day as well. They can take a week, a month, or even years to fix–or at least get better compared to before. Controlling behaviors amongst students is an exercise in management you cannot avoid, nor should you avoid.

Additionally, if you're a teacher, there are specific actions that only other staff, such as principals and security, are equipped to handle and legally allowed to handle. If it reaches that point, do not hesitate to contact one of them to try to get the situation under control. The longer it takes to control the problem, the more likely something bad will happen.

**Remember: All it takes is one disruptive, mismanaged student to ruin a classroom.**

### **Employing Negotiation Tactics**

Though it's a bit extreme of an application, you can utilize hostage negotiation strategies in a classroom setting. Don't do this everywhere, though; there's a time and place for this. 

Another way to think about negotiation is emotional contagion, where people nearby may generate the same energy you project. If you mismanage self-control and create a crisis situation out of something mundane, other people may react like it is a crisis. This likely leads to a situation that is actually out of control rather than one which was previously in control.

One book I've personally read, if you're curious about these strategies, is called *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss (2016). To explain two examples from that book, there's a section talking about how compromises aren't always the best solution and how keeping self-control is important. I'll paraphrase the following from those sections below.

**A win-win strategy–or a compromise–isn't always the ideal outcome, nor is it always a moral good to compromise for the best outcome.** Compromises are easy to do and *seem* fair, which is why compromising is often the first thing people employ when negotiating. Better solutions require creativity and have a higher payout for all sides. Still, they undergo a heavier risk and potential conflict as a barrier to reaching those solutions. 

A significant risk involved in compromises is you're often assuming, as a teacher, a student is thinking like you. That *isn't* empathy; you're not understanding their point of view. Instead, you're projecting your perspective(s) onto them and making a potentially dangerous assumption, which can escalate the situation in neither party's favor.

Unless you have self-control and can regulate emotions, you won't regain control and negative behaviors will affect the student, which causes them to spread to other students. Control also includes your tone of voice, body language, and facial expressions. About 90% of your communication, and the communication of different students, is reflected in non-verbal components instead of the actual words you're saying.

Delving into this area further brings you into the world of psychology and subjects such as calibrated questions, leverage, empathy, negotiation, deflections, and more. Keep in mind that while negotiation and manipulation seem similar and have a shared goal, the methodology used to reach that goal is vastly different. Negotiation seeks mutual benefits and understanding amongst all parties. In contrast, manipulation seeks control and tricks for one party to get what they want. Negotiation helps people, and manipulation harms people.

### **Automating your Workload**

You can automate or improve efficiency with solutions that aren't AI and probably already have before. All automation is is predefined rules to perform tasks consistently without human intervention. It's not trying to emulate human (and beyond) thinking to complete tasks like AI might. 
- All this is to say there's a good chance you need an *automated* solution and not an AI solution for your problem(s).

The general rule of thumb is that if something *can* be automated, it isn't as costly to do so, and it has strictly, pre-defined rules to ensure consistent output/quality, you should consider automating it. For example: why spend hours grading multiple-choice questions by hand when you can instantly grade them in a fraction of the time by supplying an answer key and putting it through software or even hosting the assignment on a platform like Google Forms to do most heavy-lifting for you... without *any* AI.

You want to make sure you don't automate yourself out of a job, however. I'm assuming you'd probably want to get paid for your work.

As a teacher, whatever you do should be optimized to free up more time. The more time you have, the more time you can dedicate to your other students–or matters outside of teaching.

Automation–and AI (Artificial Intelligence) by extension–is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Not everything can–and should–be automated. If you're unsure of what existing technology can automate, I'll provide examples below:

- Grading questions with discrete, well-defined, and objective answers, like the results of math equations
- Progress report submission and filling
- Sending multiple emails at once
- Tasks with repetition
- Formatting of documents
- Generating ideas and prompts
- Shortening text and summarizing

**Remember: Time is your most valuable resource. Once gone, it cannot be restored.**
- **Also remember: automation (and/or AI) can get very expensive very quickly and may not always solve EVERY problem.**
