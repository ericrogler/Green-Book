# Standards / Objectives

### [Previous Chapter](Z004a_Management_Classroom.html)

## **Short Answer**

Standards depend on what, where, and how you teach. There may be many standards or few standards to follow, so decide where to flexible on topics to enhance learning. You may also need to make concessions on content and time due to unexpected events or to stay within deadlines.

**Your main goal here is to meet all standards and go into the appropriate depth on each relevant topic.**
- Despite this goal, sometimes what matters more is not the material in the curriculum, but how you present the curriculum.

Another lesser known reality, which should be common knowledge in my opinion, is teachers have a widely varying range of autonomy when deciding standards and their curriculum. Some teachers have a nonexistent level of autonomy which means they follow a chosen curriculum as is, without significant modification, including dotting all the i's and crossing the t's. Other teachers have near 100% professional autonomy and are free to do what they need/want so long as it satisfies established standards. Teacher autonomy goes anywhere from 0% to 100%.
- This isn't to say all standardization is *bad*, but it does come with the cost of customization and differentiation.

If you're transitioning or changing into new standards or curriculums, be aware you typically can't solve every problem. Any change, however, should solve at least *some* of your major pain points.
- i.e. Achieve a "net benefit."
- This also applies to many things in life where you need to weight the benefits vs costs.
- In practice, sometimes the "best method" to teach something may not be a method supported by standards.

## **Long Answer**

**Warning: Do not cut corners with standards and objectives for your curriculum!**

There are several reasons why:

- It's hard to build a good curriculum without them
- Some teaching materials may not align with your standards
- Not adequately covering standards risks legal and financial trouble

**Once you firmly establish your standards and objectives, *then* you can be creative in your teaching methodology.** Think of these as guardrails for your curriculum preventing overemphasis in one area, defining scope, and ensuring all checks are met. They don't provide specific teaching methods or materials, but instead explicit goals for students to meet and master.

While standards can limit what is done, strong standards elevate teaching, provide direction, and include clear metrics to evaluate classroom performance. This isn't part of any legal requirement or political agenda either; it's what ensures you are effective *and* efficient with instruction.

Depending on where and what you're teaching, you might skip most of the curriculum setup and have it dictated by your State and/or District. Other times, you may receive a list of standards to meet and create your curriculum. In both cases, as well as homeschooling, you may still be constrained by your State's Department of Education standards and objectives.

As for independent teachers and instructors not creating content for public and private schools, they should expect to handle most, if not all, setup by themselves.

For people in the United States, if you're unsure how to find state education standards, look for and start with your state's Department of Education website (Colorado Department of Education, 2025a, 2025b, 2025c). For this example, I'll use Colorado's DoE website and search for K-12 academic standards.

1. Go to your State's DoE website (Colorado = CDE)
    - E.g. [https://www.cde.state.co.us/](https://www.cde.state.co.us/)  
2. Search for "Academic Standards"
3. If indexed correct, it should be on the first result page.
    - E.g. [https://www.cde.state.co.us/standardsandinstruction/standards](https://www.cde.state.co.us/standardsandinstruction/standards)  
4. From there, select a desired subject area or browse all standards.
    - E.g. [https://www.cde.state.co.us/apps/standards/](https://www.cde.state.co.us/apps/standards/)
    - You can also sort by focus and grade level.

For colleges and universities, a similar search process may occur in your specialized or institutional accreditation, providing standards you need to follow.

From there, you may find various items, such as grade-level expectations (GLEs), evidence outcomes, connections and contexts, concepts, as well as elaborations.

You may come across other sets of standards (not to be confused with curricula!) such as NGSS and Common Core as well (NextGenScience, n.d.)(Common Core State Standards Initiative, n.d.). These are efforts made by multiple states across the United States, rather than a single state or the nation's Department of Education alone. They include collaboration with organizations spanning across the nation or some select state(s), but contributing towards school curriculums (National Science Teaching Association, n.d.). Initiatives like these may also receive federal grants, but it is not always the case. States may choose to partially adopt, or adapt, standards rather than fully accepting or rejecting them.

**Let me emphasize four critical points:**

- States and districts, in the United States, "require" teachers to cover the appropriate standards. Even if everything is done correctly, you may need to shorten or summarize certain standards to stay on schedule. That's not always a failure on your part, but a reality of teaching and managing high numbers of students.
- A good set of standards can still make a poor curriculum. The inverse is also true, but significantly more challenging to achieve.
- The same set of standards and how they're implemented can vary widely from school to school, district to district, and state to state.
- Sometimes standards are not solely based on what is best for learning, but as a response to cultural and political environments they're developed in.

### **What About Standardized Tests?**

*They're a necessary evil.* 

If I were asked for an opinion, I'll claim they help high-achieving, but low-income or underprivileged, students stand on the same stage as more privileged students. I'll also claim they can promote inequality because resources heavily determine what level of preparation you get for them.

To give an example that applies, but isn't related to education to keep neutral context: Medical tests. Imagine you go to the doctor's office for a checkup, and they need to prescribe you a blood test. There might not be anything *wrong* with you, but they're making sure and ruling out possibilities. After you take the blood test, you'll get results and may see items like Albumin, WBC, RBC, Hct, Hgb, MCV, and more. These metrics are pretty well established in the medical community and doctors generally know what these metrics mean and how they're measured. They *could* be subjective on how they interpret results, which may cause a Type I or II error if severe enough, but there's a known, verified baseline they can reference and confirm results.

Scores and metrics are a thing in about every field, major, study, or area of expertise; a baseline level to determine good vs bad, big vs small, etc. If that isn't there, or cannot be agreed upon, you get multiple competiting standards and increase confusion on which standard(s) actually are valuable.

Put another way, you *need* a consistent way *people can agree on* to measure things. Standardized test scores are one of many metrics, which means they're diagnostic and used *as part of an evaluation* (more on metrics in a later chapter). 
- E.g. standardized test scores considered alongside school context for university admissions.

The ideal system would prioritize evaluating many different traits from someone, but that may not be feasible due to the testing organization's own bias, resources, or political/social pressures. It may also not be prioritized simply because society, as a whole, doesn't value a particular skill or trait, so sees no need to evaluate based on it.

Some people may be against them because it's a potential case of evaluating a fish on how well it climbs a tree like a monkey.
- Alternatively, a difference in geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds may negatively affect experience preparing for a test.

Other people may negate those same detractors by stating the student *is* the monkey and we have to see how well they can climb a tree because that's what they need to do to survive.

Additionally, standardized tests counters multiple issues with adhering to metrics (more on metrics in later chapters). For example, it would highlight discrepancies and issues such as a student getting padded scores at their local school, but failing horribly on the standard test at the state/national level. It could also bring an investigating into teachers, schools, etc. to ensure the curriculum students were supposed to get is what they're actually getting.

You can easily set your own standards at a micro level (personal/school), but not as easily at a macro level (organization/coalition). Some consistent way to verify actual ability and is not subject to easy manipulation is, in my opinion, far more trustworthy.

Though standardized tests may force curricula to be more 'rigid', they're also less likely to be taken advantage of. Couple that with an authority that *cannot* be easily swayed and it still remains a valid measure of a student's ability to do something.
