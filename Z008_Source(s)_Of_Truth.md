# Source(s) of Truth

### [Previous Chapter](Z007_Metrics_Of_Success.html)

## **Short Answer**

**"Absence of Evidence is not Evidence of Absence" – Carl Sagan, Astronomer**

Even if you are the innovator and/or pioneer of the subject/field you are teaching, you won't know *everything* and you should expect to use external sources of information to reinforce and supplement your teaching. If you find someone who knows and can do everything and anything, please tell me so I can add them to my network and get an excellent professional reference for my future career path.

## **Long Answer**

There are two sources of truth you have to work with: the knowledge you've already acquired vs the knowledge you need to seek out and use in teaching.

For both ways, I like this quotation from the former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, which he delivered on February 12, 2002.

> *"Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones."*
> 

There are three explicit categories stated here: known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns. A fourth category was observed and added by Steve Rayner in 2012, called "uncomfortable knowledge," which I'll refer to as unknown knowns.

**About teaching, you get the following:**

**Known Known**
- The domain knowledge, skills, and expertise you learned through rigorous effort and/or time.

**Known Unknown**
- Areas of knowledge you have familiarity with, such as summaries and general information, but lack the specifics and details on.

**Unknown Known** 
- Judgments, biases, and preconceived notions towards new and old information, policies, and behaviors you do without always being aware of them.

**Unknown Unknown**
- Information that you are neither aware of, understand, nor can correctly predict and expect.

### **Exploring Outside Your Field**
Though Rumsfeld mentions unknown unknowns as difficult, I'd also categorize unknown knowns as equally challenging. Beliefs, suppositions, and practices we do not know of may form the values we know of, follow, and practice.

For your curriculum and meeting standards, you'll be dealing with mainly known knowns and known unknowns. You're able to teach because you know what you're teaching. For parts you're uncertain about on the subjects you're covering (known unknowns), you're able to find and research resources elsewhere, make sense of them, and incorporate them into your teaching. In the process of researching, you'll eventually come upon information that you may or may not use in teaching, but didn't know about before, existed, or initially thought relevant to your subject(s) (unknown unknowns). Funny how intelligence work is helpful in teaching, too.

Keep in mind you're not exclusively limited to the area you're teaching. I encourage you to look beyond your field for other information you may find helpful.

Say, for example, you're teaching engineering. You don't only need to bring in engineering resources; you can bring in case studies, articles, and examples from multiple fields like management, finance, aerospace, communication, and more. From there, you can use that to gain a new perspective, link it into the material you're teaching to reinforce ideas and show practical use, or use that newfound knowledge to reinforce *how* you teach.

Here is a small list of books I used for designing a curriculum.

Despite my teaching focus on science and engineering, I found helpful information in other sources, such as communication and design books. This list is a small sample, but shows an example where looking into information outside of your field can ultimately benefit you.

### **Regarding Wikipedia**

Lastly, I'll end with a note on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is excellent as a one-stop source for what you're trying to look up. For the average layman and in general, it's a good resource.

**Now for my criticisms of Wikipedia:** 
- Wikipedia is terrible for research and is not appropriate for essay or research citations, as it doesn't follow a scientific procedure to get information (there's some irony here considering how I'm writing this guide, but I digress). 
- Any person can create an account and submit edits to Wikipedia articles, which brings into question the credentials and background of the people writing the information in the first place. 
- **A Wikipedia article does not hold the same weight as a peer-reviewed research article, *even if they have the exact same information*, due to each source's credibility.** 
- Subject to the bias of the editors on any viewpoints they may add or opinions they bring in, even if the information is factually correct. 
- You also won't figure out the reputations of sources from Wikipedia alone, as Wikipedia is a compilation of information drawn from multiple sources. 
- Stuns the ability to do research, as students may think Wikipedia is "good enough" and not bother to research beyond that.
- Information you get from Wikipedia is straightforward to change. In contrast, books, peer-reviewed articles, and the like are *not* easily changed.

Despite Wikipedia's benefits and drawbacks, a student may inevitably use it, if not at least look at it. To counter this, consider implementing the following for work where students do research:

- If you look at Wikipedia, go to the bottom of the page/article and look for headers like "References" and "External Links." Use the information from *those* sources as research and citations.
- Wikipedia is OK as a starting point, but no further.
- Ensure you're able to evaluate sources properly through critical thinking. The following links are two ways of evaluating sources:
