# Management Case A: Scaling Growth

### [Previous Chapter](Z004_Management_101.html)

## **Short Answer**

As the number of people you're responsible for increases, the policies and procedures in place need to scale to accommodate. If you do not plan appropriately, you will face stagnation or, worse, the death of the organization you're a part of.

Scaling up typically involves things like:
- New layers of management
- Specialization of roles
- Generalization of procedures to follow
- Formalization of communication and meetings
- Difficulty in cross-team communications and organizational communication

A 5 minute email can have the same, if not better, results than a 1 hour meeting. Learn when to do emails over meetings.

The typical ratio of manager to direct reports is around 1 to 7-10, given or take a few more or less direct reports, depending on role, scope, manager experience, and proficiency. It's basically a judgment call.
- If interested in why I say these numbers specifically, look further into [this paper on relationships in organization](https://www.nickols.us/relationship.pdf) and [this explanation on the formulas from Graicunas](https://www.nickols.us/graicunas.htm).

## **Long Answer**

I'm going to draw parallels from two places you may not expect to see in a book on instruction and teaching: project/product management and military organization and communications in milsim (military simulation) video games. This is split into separate chapters to distinguish certain information. 

This chapter covers organizational structures and how businesses may bring on new people and shuffle around internal employees to meet the needs of a company.

According to Tony Fadell in his book *Build* from 2022, there are multiple breakpoints for organizations at around 15 people, 40-50 people, 120-140 people, and 350-400 people. These breakpoints aren't limited either; the next chapter showcases similar breakpoints in a different application. I'm going to use these values as my own breakpoints and attempt to illustrate *why* they are these values.
- There's also mathematical formulae to help determine these values. See the Graicunas reference and paper links in the "Short Answer" section above for formulaic examples.

Organizations in both public and private sectors don't fare well past these limits without appropriate planning. This planning includes, but is not limited to, communication methods, role designation and duties, and layers of management. 

You should avoid limiting personnel as people may leave the organization and shift roles or the organization may experience growth beyond those limits.

### **How does this relate to Teaching/Instruction?**

You're technically a manager of ICs (individual contributors), but may deal with class sizes of up to 40 students, or lecture hall sessions with hundreds of students, which are past typical limits for managers and direct reports. 

You may also deal with multiple groups of up to 40+ *different* students in a single day, which means you could quickly approach the 120-140 or 350-400 people breakpoints. Sometimes this is accommodated with assistant teachers, co-teachers, and other staff. Sometimes this is not accommodated.

I'll discuss more on this below, but the general lesson is as the number of people you're responsible for increases, the policies and procedures in place need to scale to accommodate. 

### **A Quick Aside**

I'm not going into depth on matrices, or a week vs strong matrix in management. That's too high level for this book.

At best, we're going to assume 1 manager oversees X number of direct reports and make a nice and simple tree diagram across multiple levels.

I'm also not going into many edge cases, such as the manager with multiple managers *and* individual contributors under them as direct reports.

### **Business Breakpoint 0: The Start**
Fun fact, I did project management before teaching. Additionally, me and my engineering class back in college also made a business as our senior project in undergraduate study. 

*I think I'm OK talking about this.*

If you're making a business, you have to go through multiple hoops just to legally set up the business. There's registration with the State, market research, business plans, tax information, marketing plans, insurance, general management, contracts with labor and employment, licenses, banks, and many, many more.

If, for some reason, you actually want to start a business on the side, please refer to resources like [SDA.gov](https://www.sba.gov/) as more details are outside scope here.

When starting out, you'll also want to set up communications like emails and websites through official business URLs (such as "companyname.com") rather than informal, personal emails for perception amongst clients. You'll also want to document important processes first like hiring and onboarding, even if only rough drafts right now, as a clear workflow is *far* easier to manage and enforce than no workflow. 

Additionally, if having to choose between two options, like which employees to hire, with similar performances between them, then use cultural/company fit as a tie-breaker. You'll want to be careful with bringing onboard new people, because the cost of one bad hire can quickly exceed the cost of recruiting and cause organizational issues. Even if someone will perform well but they cannot adjust to the environment, it'll still create issues.
- You can also teach ability/skill, but not necessarily culture.
- A really good employee may also be worth 2+ employees as well, but you risk overdependence or overloading them with the work of 2+ employees.
- Don't expect top-tier talent unless you provide top-tier benefits to keep them around.

These things above are to solve an early scaling problem and identify what you want from your employees, and yourself, as part of your business. Properly building a foundation is key to success and makes it easier to scale up.

For now, pretend you are the CEO/owner of this newfound company as I go through those breakpoints from before and *why* I find them applicable and relevant from my own experiences looking at companies.

### **Business Breakpoint 1: 15 People**

15 people is how many people a single manager typically can manage simultaneously *as an upper limit*. A smaller breakpoint starts at around 5 direct reports per manager where relations and group management quickly explode exponentially (Chute, Gulick, & Urwick, 1938). At this stage, it's you, the manager, and the other employees as ICs.

As for typical limits, I'd expect around 5-8 direct reports if overseeing people with different roles and 9-12 direct reports when overseeing people with similar, if not the same, roles. You *could* extend beyond the 14 person breakpoint (15 people minus you, the manager) for direct reports, but it would have to be in a role requiring minimal direct intervention with individual contributors and the manager barely doing any IC level work.

You'll have two layers at this point:
1. Manager(s) (You)
2. Individual Contributors

As there's only one true manager (and perhaps assistant managers if you hire them), your main duties are management and task delegation but you may do non-management duties as well to cover deficiencies, employees taking time off, and other similar reasons. There's few bottlenecks in communication and things are straightforward. Everyone can fit into a single space without great difficulty and it's 1, maybe 2, managers directing employees/ICs.

Some small businesses may purposely stay small and still be successful. These businesses may hire contractors to perform tasks rather than hiring more new employees and these contractors are applicable at any scale of business. Business growth depends on organizational structures, revenue streams, and expense management.

### **Business Breakpoint 2: 40-50 People**

One single manager cannot reasonably handle 40-50+ people by themselves. They cannot effectively oversee this many direct reports, so a solution is a new organizational layer.

You'll have three layers at this point:
1. Director/CEO (You)
2. Managers (New)
3. Individual Contributors

If you're at the top level here, or close to the top level, above, your goals start going from managing tasks to managing people. You can no longer deal with incidents or problems as they come; you have to think steps ahead and plan out the future. This is a paradigm shift from operating tactically to operating strategically. The director+ here now develops employees, company culture, and revenue streams.
- Put another way: finding methods to earn money, improving the state of the company, and getting employees to perform better.
- If it doesn't cover one of these areas, consider delegation.

An assumed "upper limit" is about 4-5 managers with 8-10 employees each on average in a ~40-50 person organization. These people, called direct reports, are people one layer immediately below a manager, director, etc. said leader are responsible for. Contributors (ICs) report to managers, managers report to directors,  and so on. You could adjust the ratio of manager:employee and director:manager, but avoid overloading any one manager (or higher) staff member. Your initial batch of new managers can also form your C-Suite/executive board when scaling up in the future. 

You may also consider hiring on new individual contributors to assist you, the director, but remember they count towards the limit of direct reports. If their roles are not well-defined, they risk redundancy.

In smaller organizations, employee often wear multiple hats. When scaling up and expanding operations, you'll need specialists and managers to oversee new projects or expand existing projects. Generalists are still helpful, but you'll need to look into specialists to meet advanced project requirements. Some ICs may step up into management, but you may need to bring in outside managers and specialized individual contributors to fulfill new roles.

Growth near this breakpoint introduces new regulations too. For example, the Affordable Care Act, according to [the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/employers), explicitly define "50 or more full-time employees" where you legally have to change procedures and benefits to meet requirements.

Communication as a risk factor exponentially increases with scale. Large meetings, if done with 40-50 people, almost certainly lead into side conversations and distractions, which waste time and reduce productivity. Conveying vital information occurs through mainly one layer at a time rather than straight from point A to point B. This is when you learn the art of sending an email instead of hosting a meeting.

As for you, the CEO, you become a director, or a manager of managers. There are many similarities, but also differences, between managers of ICs and managers of managers:
- Rather than assist directly with tasks, you help the people helping people complete tasks
- Managers require more autonomy compared to ICs
- You have more responsibility and power, but less freedom
- You move from domain expertise to management
- Specialization occurs to avoid redundancy
- Oversight of more projects instead of only a few projects

Remaining as CEO/director at this stage requires committing more to management to maintain organizational effectiveness. Expect some loss/reduction of certain technical skills to dedicate towards learning and executing in leadership roles. It's possible only 10% of your time as director is what you would've done as an IC
- For example, if you worked on development for 8 hours as an IC, it may be only 30-45min as a director at most. Your other duties, taking up more time now, focus on improving the organization and its employees.
- This effect magnifies as your organization scales up.

If there's no employee(s) to fulfill organization responsibilities, it falls upon you and everyone else in the organization instead until you bring in more external expertise. If losing one employee risks the failure of most or all of the organization, that is failure in allocation. There should be succession plans and contingency systems across each management layer to address emergencies.

### **Business Breakpoint 3: 120-140 People**

Another layer of management appears at this stage: directors, or "middle management." Unlike the previous stage, directors are a layer between you and managers, rather than only director -> manager -> employee. Each director usually manages up to 6 direct reports and may oversee key projects/products directly if needed. At 120-140 people, you may only need 3, or even 4-5, directors.

The organization layers may look like this now:
1. President/CEO (You)
2. Directors (New)
3. Managers
4. Individual Contributors

Outside core products and projects, you'll want specialized departments and teams, such as HR, legal, and more. Outsourcing these functions exceeds a breakeven point at this scale and it's more cost-effective to bring in-house instead.

More management means reviewing meeting structures, organizational culture, and support networks for managerial staff. Management coaches and hired specialists familiar with director+ training may be contracted or hired for support. You'll also want to review communication across management layers to reduce issues like information loss.

If priorities as CEO were not already shifting, they continue at this scale and beyond as you're managing multiple systems of the organization. Scaling means reassessing and refining over time through continuous improvement.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution, as each company may experience unique problems, but there are several solutions which apply broadly across parts of an organization and solve more common problems. You'll need to assess problems specific to your business and which problems have precedent with proven solutions already.

### **Business Breakpoint 4: 350-400 People**

*Notice: This section is less from personal experience and more extrapolation from researching the topic.*

From 120-140 to 350-400 people, it's another layer of management before scaling up further. The organizational flow may look like this:

1. President/CEO (You)
2. Executive Board (New)
3. Directors
4. Managers
5. Individual Contributors

Executives (top management) establishes direction for the organization. Directors (middle management) translate that direction into strategy. Managers, (low management) develop tactics to execute strategies within teams.

Additionally, things like all-hands meetings, organization-wide events, and similar items face more problems as you scale upward:
- They become significantly more expensive
- They require more advance planning
- Risk of misusing "all-hands meetings" goes up exponentially

Scaling beyond this breakpoint seems like repeating the same strategies at larger scales, like 1000+ and 10000+. Each new breakpoint focuses on some of the following:
- Adding more middle management layers
- Creating specialized departments as needed
- Bringing services in-house which become too expensive out-of-house
- Bringing outside expertise to fill specialized roles
- Establish a steady ratio of managers:direct reports for each management layer
- Formalizing communications across layers

### **Taking Time Off**

A manager has many freedoms.

Taking time off whenever they want, however, is not typically included. At least not in the way many may think.

At a high enough leadership position, or when you're the owner/president of an organization, you're always on-call. You *could* take time off like a typical employee, but you may only manage 2-3 weeks because chaos ensues from absent leadership (and not having someone around to pay people!).

This also applies to finding coverage for roles. A manager may have to cover deficiencies for roles they cannot sufficiently delegate out or hire to fill. They may also have to take the brunt of coverage during times multiple employees need to take time off as well.

Does leadership have the same 24 hours a day like people do? Yes.

Does leadership have to spend it the same way their employees do? Rarely, if ever. Some leadership may work a lot of hours compared to a 9-5 or 40 hour per week employees doing every single job in the organization. Some leadership may do significantly less "physical" work and instead go through multiple meetings, presentations, emails, and solving people's issues instead of their own issues.

As people "climb up the ladder;" they tend to spend less time on production/labor tasks and more time in managing. That's a trait consistent across multiple roles and companies, where you "work" less, but your brain works harder. Some days could be 2 hours of smooth sailing and other days 12+ hours of putting out (almost) literal fires. This is further exacerbated by how a high level leadership mistake can have vastly greater consequences than a low level employee mistake.

This isn't a defense of executive pay disparity for people near the top vs the bottom. Some leadership roles are in a position where they *can* influence their wealth, whereas the vast majority of people *cannot* influence their wealth as easily. I'm not fully equipped to discuss or debate beyond this, however, but history is consistent on giving out more wealth to people higher on the ladder compared to people on the bottom.

### **The Bureaucratic Spiral**

As you scale up organizations, or introduce new initiatives, you should be *extremely* careful about corporatization.

What is corporatization?

Let me put it this way.

You are hired to perform a job. You *want* to just work on that job and go home. You also would like to be told specifically what you need to do rather than implicit instructions, so you can ensure you did everything OK and (hopefully) have a paper trail to show proof of work.

Despite that goal from an employee or yourself, your organization may require meetings to go over work. That's still "normal" because meetings may be a necessary evil to ensure information is communicated.

Then those meetings don't get agendas, or they take up too much time talking about non-meeting related things (like the weather, I guess).

Then those meetings have more meetings to plan future meetings out.

Then you hire people specifically to manage all of these meetings.

Then you get a new initiative to adhere to five different activity trackers because multiple levels of organization want to ensure employees are doing work to "earn" a paycheck rather than sitting around and doing nothing.

And instead of simply saying someone is doing good or bad, you design new levels of performance such as meeting expectations and exceeding expectations.
- Except "exceeding expectations" may be what people consider "meeting expectations" and ruins the new system anyway.

All of these new meetings and initiatives to meet and deal with take away time to perform the job you're originally hired to do, which now, ironically, places you and/or the employee at risk of firing/laying off.

Bureaucracy/Corporitization, when unchecked, creates the very failure it tries to prevent.

### **Scaling Down & Layoffs**

Scaling down can occur in different ways, including scope, number of projects, operations, investments, personnel counts, attrition, reduced hours, outsourcing, and more.

Generally speaking, employees react negatively to downsizing and there's multiple reasons why:
- Firing/laying off employees
- Shuffling into undesired roles
- Getting relocations
- Facing stricter policies
- Receiving reduced benefits

It is significantly harder to take away things than it is to provide things. You really need to ask yourself if some benefits for employees are *really* sustainable long-term. Some resentment appears when benefits get taken more than when they were never offered in the first place.

This isn't to say all perks are bad or excessive. Some are genuinely beneficial to employees and increase productivity.
- The CostCo hot dog combo, despite being a loss leader and staying at $1.50, is a great reason to get customers spending more and kept at that price for over 40 years.

In short, scale down carefully and with purpose. You're laser focusing on solving problems by keeping the good and cutting the bad. Handwaving away problems and pretending they don't exist will not help you.

### Final Notes for Managers

As the organization scales, the level of risk each layer takes on may increase as well. A director affecting the workflows of hundreds of employees means each decision carries more weight on average compared to a single employee at the bottom of an organizational layer.

This isn't to say managers/directors are more important than individual contributors. Even an individual contributor may cause massive amounts of damage to an organization with a single incident. Instead, this is me saying that as you're responsible for more people, the risk of something going wrong, and the price of that risk, also scales up.

Additionally, as the differences in layers emerge, there is a risk of "general incompetence" in *every* manager in an organization. This is when managers, directors, etc. are colloquially called "idea guys" and expect implementation of new products, trends, ideas, and more without proper knowledge or consideration for feasibility. 
- If you are in a managerial or leadership position, you are very much at risk of general incompetence.

This same general incompetence applies cross-functionally as well. You may have two separate teams, such as marketing and engineering, where one team barely understands what the other team is doing and pitches product(s) potentially misrepresented to clients, leading to a loss in business and trust.
