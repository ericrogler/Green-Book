# Management 101

### [Previous Chapter](Z003_Legality.html)

## **Short Answer**

**Prepare for the worst, but assume the best of students.** You may also need licensure or certifications to teach certain subjects or do certain tasks legally, such as administering medicine to students

- Also never be alone with 2 or fewer students in a room without the door open.

## **Long Answer**

Teaching is either extremely hands-off (many online “courses” avoid interfacing with students almost entirely) or extremely hands-on.

Students range from a variety of backgrounds across multiple demographics. What may work for one student may not work for another, and how a student behaves in class differs across every student. Some students may also respect the authority of a teacher and be respectful to other students, and some students will actively undermine the education of their peers, interrupt you when a chance presents itself, or even resort to physical contact.

This is a reality of the environment many teachers and instructors deal with on a daily, if not hourly, basis when inside of a classroom setting.

**You still need to plan for the worst-case scenarios.**

If you can figure out how to handle students at their worst, then you can handle them at every other degree of behavior.

### **Everyday Classroom Management Rules**

There’s rules you need to follow with every management style:

- **It must be legal for you to do.**
- No means no. If you do not allow something, you MUST be willing and able to enforce that. The moment you do not, it becomes a rule that students–adults and minors–know can be broken.
- Appropriate punishments for appropriate behaviors. A student talking out of turn can be resolved with a warning, but that same student actively bullying another cannot be solved the same way and requires escalation.
- Ignore any type of attention seeking behavior, as not every quip or comment a student makes is worth your time or even a reply.
- A management style you’re comfortable with is a management style you’ll enforce and follow more easily.
- Determine where “the line” is and do not move it unless absolutely necessary. Regardless of age, if someone can get away with something, they will try to do it.
- People listen to the advice of someone who knows what they’re talking about more readily than someone who doesn’t know what they’re talking about. If you lose the perception you know what you’re talking about, you also lose respect and weaken the ability to teach properly to students (or a group/audience in general).

### **Enforcing Control**

Success varies greatly depending on what type of group you’re teaching, but some strategies are universal and applicable at various degrees of success with groups.

One single list will not solve all your problems. You’ll need to adjust strategies over time and this is something you have to do in practice rather than only read about. Other times, you don’t have time to mentally review the entire list and may have less than a few seconds to get back control before chaos occurs.

**Here's some examples to enforce control of the room:**

- Establish a routine. If they know what to do without constant reminders, they’re less likely to go out-of-turn.
- Clearly define the rules. Explicitly stated rules are followed and enforced better than implied rules.
- Shouting matches don’t work. The first one to shout is the one that loses, so don’t be the first one to shout.
- Remain calm.
- Determine where “the line” is and do not move it unless necessary.
- Do not carelessly give away rewards for good behavior, as they can be detrimental to intrinsic motivation by replacing it with extrinsic motivation.
- Be prepared to have a reason for why something is done. If it’s because “you said so,” it’s not something you should do.
- Even if restricted by what you may teach, getting students to choose what they want to learn may increase their desire to learn and motivation to do well. (similar topic: “stakeholder buy-in”)
- Calling out a student directly is more effective than simply stating “stop causing trouble” without calling out the person causing the trouble.
- Use statements over orders. Short and precise is best. “Fix it, please.” “Do [thing], please.”
    - If a statement is over 10 seconds long, it’s too long. You can shorten it.
- Establish ways to set rapport. You don’t need to be–or should be–their friends, but you do need to earn their respect.
- Be ready to “pull the trigger” when disciplining.
- Decide where and how you want people to sit, stand, or otherwise for a classroom, whether by strict assignment or casually (i.e. “just sit in a chair”)
    - For online teaching, decide what they need to set up on their computer, phone, etc. to properly receive information and do tasks you assign.
- **Regulate the use of AI by students when possible (more on that later).**

### **Attention Economy**

The amount of time a student can focus depends on many factors, such as age, disposition, and personality. 

Generally speaking, the younger students are, the less time they can maintain focus before needing a break. A common rule of thumb is a younger student's *maximum* attention span is 2 to 3 times their age (e.g. 13 years old = 26-39 minutes) before a short break is needed. The [**Pomodoro technique**](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) is one example of a management method capitalizing on attention spans.

Since 2020 and COVID, there is a proliferation of short-form content, like TikTok videos and YouTube shorts. Due to their implementation of highly optimized psychological techniques to get your time, which are also found in similar apps and software, maintaining focus in a classroom is set to Hard mode by default. It’s not impossible, but you’re starting off at a hefty disadvantage. Rather than demonize this software, it may help you, as a teacher, to figure out *why* these methods grab attention so effectively and see if you can use that in teaching.

If a student wants to learn something, they'll at least try to learn something–which may not be what you're teaching. It’s not always a case of the student intentionally doing something bad, but something else caught their attention more at the time or they got confused on something and are now acting out.

**Fighting for attention can be remedied with some of these techniques.** They may not work perfectly and their effects vary, but it’s significantly better than *not* using any of them.

- Keep an overall level of focus (look up “utilization rate”) at 85% to 90%.
    - Some mental wandering, breaks, and loss of focus midway from students should be expected and accounted for.
    - Multiple study techniques are designed with breaks, so learning and teaching techniques should incorporate breaks too.
- Do not carelessly give away rewards for good behavior, as they can be detrimental to intrinsic motivation by replacing it with extrinsic motivation.
    - This means less interest in whatever you’re trying to teach as their goal is now the reward and not the knowledge you’re imparting.
- Plan for potential breaks during classroom sessions.
    - For example, a 45-minute lecture can turn into 2, 20-minute parts with a few minutes break midway for a significant boost in retention, attention, and learning.
    - Just because a student *can* maintain focus for 50 minutes doesn’t necessarily mean they always *should* do that every class.
- Get creative and use visuals to supplement material you’re trying to teach.
    - Images tend to be far more pleasant to look at than large bodies of text and easier to digest information from when created properly.
- For presentations and lectures taught with a presentation screen of some sort, limit it to <= 50 words on a screen at a time.
    - **If you have to present more than that amount of words at once, prepare a means to highlight, underline, or accentuate parts you want to call attention to.**

### **Positive and Negative Student Behaviors**

*This usually applies to younger students, but older and adult learners can have behavior issues too.* 

Two categories I’ll put behaviors in are positive and negative.

Every student wants to be understood and accepted, but each student has different ways of getting that acknowledgement. Negative behaviors can be replacements for lack of attention or acknowledgement for many people.

Positive behaviors are behaviors you want to enforce and reward, such as giving attention to, providing *random* acknowledgements, and compliments. These behaviors vary across teachers, but generally they are things you want students to do and how you want them to act. For behaviors you want to see, you provide a clear path to reach them and indications they are reaching positive behaviors along the way to the goal.

Negative behaviors are behaviors that put you, the classroom, or other students in a disadvantageous position and threaten the sanctity of the learning environment. Whenever a negative-attention seeking behavior occurs from a student, I prefer two ways to handle it.

1. Shut it down immediately.
    1. All it takes is a few seconds for control to be lost, your authority diminished, and the rest of the class/audience to see an opportunity to make it worse.
2. Ignore it entirely.
    1. This doesn’t mean being harsh, but ignoring them means figuring out later how to replace negative behaviors with positive behaviors.

I’ll talk more about these when I reach learning methodologies, but these negative behaviors require stern management. Negative behaviors tend to have these traits in common:

- Acquiring social attention
- May start mild and innocent, but devolve into something worse
- A reason behind the negative behavior

If a student shows signs of one of the following, or something related, do not feed into the attention they’re seeking or it will spiral out of control:

- Overly dramatic reactions
- Dramatic or provocative behavior
- Fishing for compliments
- Excessive noise-masking
- Pushing boundaries
- Bullying others in the classroom
- Talking out of turn

Even if you mitigate negative behaviors, it doesn’t always mean they’re gone entirely. There is a reason behind the negative behavior. It is up to you to figure it out or else the negative behavior will repeat again. These negative behaviors also occur outside of a school setting and aren’t limited to students; your fellow staff, other adults, and children may also show them.

Negative behaviors will rarely resolve in a single day as well. They can take a week, a month, or even years to resolve–or at least get better compared to before. Controlling behaviors amongst students is an exercise in management you cannot avoid, nor should you avoid.

Additionally, if you're a teacher, there’s certain actions only other staff, such as principals and security, are equipped to handle and legally allowed to handle. If it reaches that point, do not hesitate to contact one of them to try to get the situation under control. The longer it takes to control the situation, the more likely something bad will happen.

**Remember: All it takes is one disruptive, mismanaged student to ruin a classroom.**

### **Employing Negotiation Tactics**

Though it’s a bit extreme of an application, you can utilize hostage negotiation strategies in a classroom setting. Don’t do this everywhere though; there’s a time and place for negotiations. One book I’ve read, if you’re curious about these strategies, is called *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss. There’s many different things you can take from negotiation tactics, but I’ll limit it to a few parts below.

**A win-win strategy–or a compromise–isn’t always the ideal outcome nor is it always a moral good to compromise for the best outcome.** Compromises are easy to do and *seem* fair, which is why compromising is often the first thing people employ when negotiating. Better solutions require creativity and have a higher payout for all sides, but they undergo heavier risk and potential conflict as a barrier to reach those solutions. A major risk involved in compromises is you’re often assuming, as a teacher, that a student is thinking like you. That *isn’t* empathy; you’re not understanding their point of view. Instead, you’re projecting your perspective(s) onto them instead and making a potentially dangerous assumption which can escalate the situation in neither party’s favor.

Students are more comfortable around rules and situations where it is “fair” to them. If something is perceived as unfair, that’s another avenue for students to stack on negative behaviors and cause issues in the classroom. From personal experience, students seem to react more when something is about to be taken away, or given a “No,” rather than given to them or getting a “Yes” despite the fact they are the ones causing the loss to themselves.

It’s important to exercise self-control in negotiation and defusing situations. Unless you have self-control and can regulate emotions, you won’t resume control and negative behaviors will affect the student causing them, which may spread to other students. Control also includes your tone of voice, body language, and emotions that show on your face. About 90% of your communication–and the communication of other students–is reflected in non-verbal components instead of the actual words you’re saying.

Delving into this area further brings you into the world of psychology and into subjects such as calibrated questions, leverage, empathy, negotiation, deflections and more. Keep in mind that while negotiation and manipulation seem similar and have a shared goal, the methodology used to reach that goal is vastly different. Negotiation seeks mutual benefits and understanding amongst all parties, whereas manipulation seeks control and tricks for one party to get what they want. Negotiation helps people and manipulation harms people.

### **Automating your Workload**

General rule of thumb is if something *can* be automated, you probably should automate it. Why spend hours grading multiple choice questions by hand when you can instantly grade them in a fraction of time by supplying an answer key and putting it through software, or even hosting the assignment on a platform like Google Forms?

However, you also want to make sure you don't automate yourself out of a job. You'd probably still want to get paid, I'd assuming.

**Remember: Time is your most valuable resource. Once gone, it cannot be restored.**
- **Also remember: automation can be expensive and may not always solve EVERY problem.**

As a teacher, whatever you do should be optimized to get you back more time. The more time you have, the more time you can dedicate to your other students–or matters outside of teaching.

Automation–and AI (Artificial Intelligence) by extension–is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Not everything can–and should–be automated. If you’re unsure of what can be automated with existing technology, I’ll provide examples below:

- Grading questions with discrete, well-defined and objective answers, like the results to math equations
- Progress report submission and filling
- Sending multiple emails at once
- Tasks with repetition
- Formatting of documents
- Generating ideas and prompts
- Shortening text and summarizing
