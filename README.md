### Wait, a book hosted on GitHub?

Yea! It's unconventional to host a book on this platform and I was against it at first and almost developed a website instead.

Surprisingly though, it has more benefits than expected:
- Version control capabilities
- Text styles
- Break points
- Supported on any text tool editor
- WYSIWYG
- Can be converted further from here
- You can copy it freely and without issue
- Hosting as a repository on GitHub generates a free URL with my name on it--a feature you normally pay extra for on web hosting and custom domains
- It's self-published, so no other middle man.
- It's free for you, the user/reader.
