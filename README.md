### Wait, a book hosted on GitHub?

Yea! I'm aware it's unconventional to host a book on this platform, and I was against it at first and almost developed a website instead.

Surprisingly though, it has more benefits than expected:
- Version control capabilities
- Text styles
- Break points
- Supported on any text tool editor
- WYSIWYG
- Can be converted further from here
- You can copy it freely and without issue
- Hosting as a repository on GitHub generates a free URL with my name on it--a feature you normally pay extra for on web hosting and custom domains
- It's self-published, so no other middle man.
- It's free for you, the user/reader.

## Navigating on BOTH Mobile + Desktop

There's multiple ways to view this repository, so I'll go over mobile, desktop, and both. "Mobile" implies phones and tablets.

1. Click or tap on the folder labeled "Chapters" inside of the repository
2. This pulls up a new page displaying all of the files inside of the folder
3. At this point, you can click on any file to start reading.
4. For an "official" starting point, please begin at "001_Manager_TLDR" as it contains a succinct summary of what you'll read and learn about.
5. At the end of each chapter, there is a CTA (Call-to-action) called "Next Section" you can click to go through each chapter one by one.
6. If you need to go back to any chapter, open up the "Chapters" folder and select the appropriate chapter.

## Mobile Specific Navigation

**For Step 6 under "Navigating on BOTH Mobile + Desktop"**
1. Click the "Chapter" folder hyperlink at the top of the page
2. This brings you out of the display of the current chapter you're on into the folder with all chapters.
3. From there, select the desired chapter you wish to view.

## Desktop Specific Navigation

**For Step 6 under "Navigating on BOTH Mobile + Desktop"**

**Monitor Width >= ~1280p ("p" = pixels)**
1. You'll have a side navigation bar on the left hand side of your screen
2. Simply select the desired chapter in that navigation and it will change the preview to that chapter.

**Monitor Width < ~1280p ("p" = pixels)**
1. Follow the steps under "Mobile Specific Navigation" above to navigate across different chapters.
