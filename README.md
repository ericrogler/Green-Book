Welcome to *The Green Book (For Teachers, Instructors, Presenters, Students, and Learning Designers)*. Included is the license involved with this work and a chapter navigation if you'd rather go to a specific topic. This is a web-friendly version hosted on Github and created through Visual Studio Code. You do not need to access the main repository unless you want to.

### Wait, a book hosted on GitHub?

Yea! It's unconventional to host a book on this platform and I was against it at first and almost developed a website instead.

Surprisingly though, it has more benefits than expected:
- Version control capabilities
- Text styles
- Break points
- Supports Markdown
- Can be converted further from here
- You can copy it freely and without issue
- It's self-published, so no other middle man
- It's free for you, the user/reader
