# 23. Action Plan: Month 1

### [Previous Chapter](Z022_Action_Plan_Week_1.html)

## **Short Answer**

*This period occurs between after week 1 to end of month 1.*

After the first week, which may be chaotic, the goal is putting together and finding resources you'll use often throughout the teaching period. This may still require some time outside of work to complete.

If there's items from week 1 not complete, then get those done as soon as possible.

## **Long Answer**

Things get easier after week 1 and the next challenge is making it through month 1, assuming you kept to the classroom management plan and ensured troublemaker's actions saw the appropriate consequences. 

If week 1 was setting up the foundation, then month 1 is consolidating and sorting the resources needed to build up and maintain a functioning classroom.

This timeframe is difficult precisely because everything is still "new." Expect to still spend time outside work hours in this month. Just like in week 1, it's like paying down a loan; if you pay extra money now towards the principal on top of the interest, the average interest across all future pay periods decreases.

**By end of month 1, aim to have most of the following sorted out:**

- A document, table, or database with key links to organizations, suppliers, software, resources, etc.
  - You can update this over time, but get the majority done in month 1.
- Student seating assignments (if applicable).
- Lesson plans for next week.
- Knowing how to use the grading system.
- Templates for assignments, quizzes, projects, labs, and tests.
- Ideas for how to approach the unit(s) and topic(s) you're covering (see "Agile Teaching Framework" for example).
- Software/account issues resolved for students and teacher(s).
- Student contact information stored and organized.
- Outstanding payments from students collected (if applicable).
  - If still outstanding, send gentle reminders via email or other contact methods.

Month 1 is storing and organizing your "teaching database" to quickly access and retrieve information from. Cleaning and organizing takes up the bulk of setup time before its usable, but it's worth taking extra time to get your ducks in a row.

### **Lesson Plans (Post Week 1)**

After week 1, your principal or another administrator may set expectations for lesson plan structures. Safest bet is to just follow that.

**If you don't have a "boss," though, you'll want to check for questions like these:**

- What are the learning objectives?
- What materials are needed, if any?
- What part(s) of the topics are covered today?
- What homework, if any, is assigned?
- What goals am I trying to reach today?
- How long will it take to get through the topic(s)?
- Can I access and utilize the resources needed for the lesson at this time?

If you can answer those questions, you're doing OK. Your lesson plan can be short or long, so long as it meets your objectives and fits within your deadlines.

### **Templates (Assignments, Tests, etc.)**

Templates save time. One master template should be built for each type of work you'll do with static fields where students write information, such as answers and names, and includes dynamic fields, such as directions, questions, images, visuals, and more, you can edit and swap out.

When templates are set up, every new assignment takes half the time to complete thanks to copy and paste. You'll still need time to add content, but formatting was half the battle fought and won now.

**When feasible, use or create a template.** There are rare exceptions, but they're quite uncommon. You can also template lesson plans and other documents as well.
