# Probability and Statistics

### [Previous Chapter](Z007x_Math_And_Calculus.html)

## **Short Answer**

WIP

*Notice: This entire chapter is, at best, a surface level view of each topic covered here. That is intentional.*

The average person will probably not go beyond basic concepts for Probability and Statistics unless they seek it out themselves, is required for a job, are or going through a math-heavy field of study.
- E.g. you may not use statistical *calculations*, but you may utilize statistical *reasoning.*

You might be brushing up on probability and statistics due to the popularity of ML/AI (machine learning and artificial intelligence). For a lot of use cases, like applying ready-made solutions, statistics is about all you need. Going beyond, however, still requires advanced math like Calculus, Linear Algebra, and what vectorized operations are.

Knowing how to do something is great. Knowing where to look up something is good. Not knowing anything about it is a sign.

## **Long Answer**

Learning Statistics and Probability typically requires an advanced mathematical foundation before beginning. This is usually 1-2 years of Calculus, with all of its prerequisites, and/or Linear Algebra; often accomplished around late high school/early college age for students (17-21 years old) as of 2025.

Do Statistics and Probability *require* Calculus? For their applied versions, no, but their mathematical and theory versions I'd say yes. 

Should you still learn them? Personally, yes.

When I did Statistics courses (yes, not just one) as an undergraduate, they shyed away from Calculus and in-depth theorems and focused more on Algebra. That isn't necessarily *bad* as you can still do multiple things, like z-scores, ANOVA, t-tests, hypothesis testing, linear regression, and normal distributions. 

Intuitive understanding is possible without formal training and one can learn the tricks to implement algorithms and procedures without insight in how they work. Older elementary school students or middle school students (ages 9-10+) could learn about parts of probability before knowing all the math behind it just fine. 

Someone could also have insight into how something should be done, but lack the presence or knowledge of technical tools to solve their problems. When you dive into advanced proofs and theorems, as well as develop and modify ways to solve new problems, Calculus and formal training in math saves a lot of learning time and headaches down the line.

Statistics and Probability I find caters to students in two ways: those who need to understand these fields in-depth (e.g. data scientists, graduates and PhDs in technical fields, etc.) and those who may need to use them in general (basically everyone else). The former absolutely needs a strong math background, whereas the latter can get away with a weaker math background. Both backgrounds, however, should strive to understand *how* and *when* to use Statistics and Probability.

That said, lets go over concepts.

### **Probability vs Statistics**

Probability is the likelihood an event occurs. That's it, but also not it.

There's an inverse relationship between Probability and Statistics. 

Probability uses a model (or hypothesis) to predict what may happen in practice. 

Statistics starts with data obtained from practice (or experiments), observes what *has* happened, and figures out what the model/process is.

People may typically learn Probability before Statistics. Probability doesn't need Statistics, but Statistics does need Probability. Though one may not need the other, they still complement each other. Some curricula may account for this relationship and teach both topics at the same time, such as showing the probablistic object after talking about its theoretical definition.
