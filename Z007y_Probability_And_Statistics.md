# Probability and Statistics

### [Previous Chapter](Z007x_Math_And_Calculus.html)

## **Short Answer**

WIP

*Notice: This entire chapter is, at best, a surface level view of each topic covered here. That is intentional.*

This is continuing from 8a and covering Probability and Statistics specifically.

The average person will probably not go beyond these concepts in these fields for their purposes.

As a reminder why this is important: you'll want advanced knowledge precisely to know when an advanced method is not the best course of action and to know how to manipulate advanced methods to better suit your needs.

## **Long Answer**

Learning Statistics and Probability typically requires an advanced mathematical foundation before beginning. This is usually 1-2 years of Calculus, with all of its prerequisites, and/or Linear Algebra; often accomplished around late high school/early college age for students (17-21 years old) as of 2025.

Do they *require* Calculus? No. Should you still learn it? Personally, yes.

When I did Statistics as an undergraduate, they shyed away from Calculus and in-depth theorems and focused more on Algebra. That isn't necessarily *bad* as you can still do multiple things, like z-scores, ANOVA, t-tests, hypothesis testing, linear regression, and normal distributions. 

Intuitive understanding is possible without formal training and one can learn the tricks to implement algorithms and procedures without insight in how they work. Someone could also have insight into how something should be done, but lack the presence or knowledge of technical tools to solve their problems. When you dive into advanced proofs and theorems, as well as develop and modify ways to solve new problems, Calculus and formal training in math saves a lot of learning time and headaches down the line.

Statistics and Probability I find caters to students in two ways: those who need to understand these fields in-depth (e.g. data scientists, graduates in technical fields, and PhDs) and those who may need to use them (everyone else). The former absolutely needs a strong math background, whereas the latter can get away with a weaker math background. Both backgrounds, however, still need to understand *how* and *when* to use Statistics and Probability.

That said, lets go over some things you may encounter.

### **Interpretability vs Accuracy**

(Don't retain the following)

```At a certain point in statistics you start developing models, and one of the things that comes up is the tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy. And in every class I've ever taken, there is a strong bias towards developing models that are interpretable over those that might be more accurate. ```

### **Probability (before Statistics)**

Probability is the likelihood an event occurs. That's it, but also not it.

There's an inverse relationship between Probability and Statistics, however. Probability uses a model (or hypothesis) to predict what may happen in practice. Statistics starts with data obtained from practice (or experiments), observes what *has* happened, and figures out what the model/process is.

Usually you learn Probability *before* Statistics. Probability doesn't need Statistics, but Statistics does need Probability. Though one may not need the other, they still complement each other.
