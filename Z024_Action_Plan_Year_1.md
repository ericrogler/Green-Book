# 24. Action Plan: Year 1

### [Previous Chapter](Z023_Action_Plan_Month_1.html)

By end of Year 1, you should have your bearings in the classroom and an idea of your teaching style. You'll know which activities work, which activities don't, and how you prefer to deliver lectures, tests, quizzes, and more. You may have also formed initial impressions, conscious or not, of many students as well.

At this point, focus on refinement and continous improvement of teaching systems. Teaching combines many roles into one and you'll want to develop yourself professionally. Advice from here only helps if you put it into pracice and implement it.

**Here are some questions I would consider at this timeframe, if I have not already:**
- Are there resources I haven't considered yet that I should look into for teaching?
- Is there a more efficient way to do [thing/process/method]?
- Is there a more effective way to do [thing/process/method]?
- Are students meeting behavior expectations?
    - If not, what can I do to make them behave better in class?
- Can I still make curriculum deadlines?
- How do I better plan for unexpected events?
- How can I make this topic easier to learn / more accessible?
- Is there a way of learning I haven't explored yet?
- Have I overlooked potential accommodations?
- Are there other problems to solve?

For first-year teachers, your main goal is survival. After the first year, you hopefully start shifting from catch-up to routine. After meeting the essentials, you focus on self-reflection and growth. The questions above don't need to wait until the end of year 1; they can start before that time as well.

### **A Note on Effectiveness vs Efficiency**

You may think about effectiveness and efficiency during reflection. These are two terms used in similar contexts and fields, but they are not interchangeable. It doesn't take a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering or a Six Sigma black belt to tell you that. I'll spare you a thesis and describe it in a few different ways:

1. An effective but inefficient solution solves a problem, whereas an ineffective but efficient solution does not solve a problem.
2. Once you learn that everything is a system, it gets easier to spot inefficiencies you missed before.
3. From *The Effective Executive* (Drucker, 2017): “Efficiency is doing things right. Effectiveness is doing the right thing."
