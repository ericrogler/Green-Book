**This book focuses on a breadth of information rather than extensive depth into a few topics.**

Due to contract terms and laws limiting use of personally identifying information, I cannot fully share materials, examples, or information to remain HIPAA/FERPA compliant.

- **Your overall mission is turning complex subjects into simple(r) lessons.**
- **If you cannot develop good soft skills and communicate well, you cannot achieve excellence.**
    - This includes emotional control and the ability to stay calm.
- Teaching is a combination of preparation and luck.
    - Preparation is creating great lesson plans, curricula, management plans, etc.
    - Luck is not getting blindsided by chaos and hoping students behave on any given day.
- Teaching is many different fields merged in a single profession.
    - **You are, however, NOT a therapist.**
- What you legally follow depends on your location, subject, and place of employment.
- **Plan and prepare for the worst, but assume the best.**
- Plan a class as if there's only one teacher in the room for all students.
- Many classroom management systems should scale to hundreds or even thousands of students.
- What you need to do depends heavily on what, where, and how you're teaching.
    - You may need to adapt your curriculum and make concessions.
- Certain tasks require licenses or certifications.
- Even experts rely on external sources.
- Every student wants to be understood and accepted.
- Compromises are easy, but not always best or ethical solutions.
- Topics can block into 1-4 week periods and include a balance of lectures, activities, projects, and tests.
- Be ready to adjust lesson plans daily.
- *Every* subject requires storytelling for student investment.
- Summaries work well. Use them.
- Good lectures engage and bad lectures bore.
- The best way to learn varies across topics, and you can teach multiple ways at once.
- In-class time should balance homework loads. More class time = less homework.
- Collaborating with parents, administrators, and peers is essential.
- If you treat your peers well, you'll (likely) get treated well in turn.
- Learn to work with people you dislike and act professionally with them.
- Don't use AI for learning if students do not know how to use AI safely.
- Money is always a constraint; spend it carefully.
- Templates are king, so learn to design reusable materials.
