# A Manager TL;DR

### **My Role Overview**

- **Duration:** 2 years
- **Role:** Teacher (In-Person, NOT Online)
- **School Types:** Secondary and Primary Education; public & private schools

### **Results**

Designed multiple full-year science curricula in my first year of teaching. Achieved this with strong time management during contract hours, which resulted in high student performance across all classes.

## 2 Years of Teaching in <2 Minutes

Due to a teaching contract, I cannot easily provide curriculum materials as I *technically* don’t own them; the school/district does. All examples and information are HIPAA/FERPA compliant.

- **Your overall mission is turning complex subjects into simple(r) lessons.**
- Teaching is many different fields merged together in a single profession.
    - You are, however, NOT a therapist.
- What you legally follow depends on your location, subject, and place of employment.
- Plan and prepare for the worst, but assume the best, of students.
- Plan a class as if there’s only one teacher in the room for all students.
- What you need to do depends heavily on what, where, and how you’re teaching.
    - Sometimes you need to make concessions on material covered and make your own curriculum materials to fit standards.
- You may need a license or certification to teach certain subjects or do certain tasks legally, such as administering medicine to students.
- Even if you’re the leading expert in your subject, you won’t know *everything* and you should expect to use external sources to supplement teaching.
- Every student wants to be understood and accepted.
- Compromises are easy solutions, but not always the best or morally correct solution.
- Many subjects and topics can be blocked into short, fixed-time periods of 1, 2, or 4 weeks and include a balance of lectures, activities, projects, and tests.
- Be ready and able to adjust lesson plans as needed, even on a day-by-day basis.
- E*very* subject requires teachers to communicate well through storytelling. If you cannot communicate well, then you cannot get students to invest into learning.
- If something can be explained well in a short summary, use a short summary.
- Good lectures are not boring. Bad lectures are boring.
- The best way to learn varies across topics and you can teach multiple ways at once.
- The time spent in class should make up for the time spent on homework and it also depends heavily on the subject. More time in class = less time in homework.
- Collaborating people outside of students, like parents and administrators, is necessary. If you cannot do this well, you’ll have a hard time as a teacher.
- If you treat your peers well, you’ll (likely) get treated well in turn.
- You’ll need to learn how to work with people you don’t agree with and learn how to not take things personally.
- Don’t use AI for learning if students do not know how to use AI safely and properly.
- Money is always a constraint when teaching. Be careful on how you spend it.
- Templates are king, so learn to design reusable materials.
