# Homework

### [Previous Chapter](Z011_Learning_Methodologies.html)

## **Short Answer**

The time spent in class should make up for the time spent on homework, and this varies significantly by subject.

## **Long Answer**

Recall the previous section where I talked about blockers to student learning and the ability to teach.

Homework *can*–but not always will–infringe on those four blockers I talked about: technology, physical, monetary, and interpersonal. Student A may not have the same support systems as Student B. Even though you gave them the same assignment, they may not have the same opportunities and availability to complete it to the best of their ability.

The goal of equity here is providing *opportunity* to those in less fortunate circumstances or those with disabilities or impairments.

Before you start parading equity as the end-all, be-all solution, consider the following argument:

In tertiary education, like college, you may only see your professors for 3 hours *each week* in a semester. In secondary education, such as high school and middle school, you may see teachers for about 50 minutes to 1 hour per day, if not more, Monday to Friday each week. The in-class time you have across different types of education varies significantly, so what you can get done during class and teach, review, practice, etc., also differs significantly.

It's why college classes expect *more* out of students outside of class compared to high school classes. The total work may be about the same in both education levels (unless it's post-graduate, then definitely more outside work). Still, the amount of work you can do in a classroom in college is less, so there's more out-of-class work to compensate and make up for the practice, learning, etc., you need. The work amount is by design and due to the constraints imposed upon teaching. Professors and teachers aren't always giving you homework because they dislike you; they're doing it to stay within deadlines and to get you the appropriate practice for the material they're covering to ensure you're learning as they intend you to.

In a high school or lower educational setting, you may only need some to no homework depending on your subject and how rigorous the class is (e.g., AP History vs. "normal" history). For subjects like music, athletics, and math, there is a significant amount of learning by doing over listening/remembering only, so homework is likely. For other subjects, more work is doable in class, so it doesn't *always* have to become homework and give more work outside of an 8-to-4 or 7-to-3 schedule secondary and primary education students already have to follow.

Now, to talk about why homework for students means more homework for you, the teacher.

### Do I give more or less homework?

Every assignment you issue is an assignment you'll likely have to grade. Multiply that by the number of students you're teaching, and you may find, just grading alone, homework may take hours, if not multiple work days, to accomplish.

Multiply that value again by the number of students for whom you have to rewrite the assignment due to disabilities and accommodations. What seems like minor changes and a simple homework assignment inevitably scales exponentially as you have more students. Remember, time is your most valuable asset; you do not want to waste it.

You should not give out homework you are not willing to grade, if you can help it. If you do have to give out graded homework, figure out if there's a way to automate or quickly accomplish the grading process. If you cannot automate it or quickly grade it, then see if you can structure or refine the assignment for more efficient grading, whether by limiting the number of questions or the types of responses permitted for questions.

Multiple choice questions, math/science problems with discrete solutions, and any questions with one solution work best here, because all you need to do is make a key. If their answers don't match your answers, it's easy to cross-reference and grade.

- In data analysis terms, it's matching 1-to-1 questions to answers, rather than 1-to-many questions to answers.

These types of questions are easy to automate compared to qualitative problems and questions with a multitude/range of correct answers, which means you save more time. We like saving time.

The method I stuck with was "implied homework" for teaching, which meant explicitly telling students I'm putting the responsibility on them to properly prepare for tests, assignments, etc., based on any information and explanations I gave during classroom time. I told students what to expect from the test and what I'll try to cover in each unit. 

Suppose I don't go over a particular subject. In that case, I figure out if there's a way to summarize it and potentially exclude it from a unit's exam. 

This setup eliminated virtually all of my homework, except for math-heavy science and engineering topics, but vastly increased the number of "tests" I issued at the end of each unit in-class to compensate and ensure students were adequately prepared for and learned the appropriate subjects.

Another "implied" homework I gave, but didn't explicitly grade, was allowing a "cheat sheet" for tests. Cheat sheets had varied results, so if I were to do it again, I'd do the following:

- A notecard size at most. An entire page of 8.5 x 11 paper can fit in nearly the whole exam if a student is willing to write small enough–and they most certainly are eager.
- Force it to be in writing. It forces students to commit to what they should put on a cheat sheet vs trying to remember, and stops the "copy+paste" problem of computer-based notes.

There are cases where you can permit an open book test as well, but reserve those for topics with exceptional depth and where a student should utilize how to *find* things in the book(s) allowed for answers rather than knowing every detail in the book.

Overall, though, don't give out homework unless necessary. Try your best, as a teacher, to accomplish what you need to get students to learn within the classroom setting.
