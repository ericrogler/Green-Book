## **Short Answer**

The time spent in class should make up for the time spent on homework and it also depends heavily on the subject.

## **Long Answer**

Recall the previous section where I talked about blockers to student learning and ability to teach.

Homework *can*–but not always will–infringe on those four blockers I talked about: technology, physical, monetary, and interpersonal. Student A may not have the same support systems as Student B. Even though you gave them the same assignment, they may not have the same opportunities and availability to complete it to the best of their ability.

This is where equity comes in: providing *opportunity* to those in less fortunate circumstances or those with disabilities or impairments.

Before you start parading equity as the end-all, be-all solution, consider the following argument:

In tertiary education, like college, you may only see your professors for 3 hours *each week* in a semester. In secondary education, like high school and middle school, you may see teachers for about 50 minutes to 1 hour *per day, if not more,* Monday to Friday each week. The in-class time you have across different types of education varies significantly, so what you can get done during class and teach, review, practice, etc. also varies significantly.

It’s why college classes expect *more* out of students outside of class compared to high school classes. The total work may be about the same in both education levels (unless it’s post-graduate, then definitely more outside work), but the amount of work you can do in a classroom in college is less, so there’s more out-of-class work to compensate and make up for the practice, learning, etc. you need. This is by design and due to the constraints imposed upon teaching. Professors and teachers aren’t always giving you homework because they dislike you; they’re doing it to stay within deadlines and to get you the appropriate practice for the material they’re covering to ensure you're learning as they intend you to.

In a high school or lower educational setting, you may only need some to no homework depending on your subject and how rigorous the class is (e.g. AP History vs “normal” history). For subjects like music, athletics, and math, there is a significant amount of learning by doing over listening/remembering only, so homework may be expected there. For other subjects, a lot of work can be done in class so it doesn’t *always* have to become homework and give more work outside of a 8-to-4 or 7-to-3 schedule secondary and primary education students already have to follow.

That argument is done. Now to talk about why homework for students means more homework for you: the teacher.

### Do I give more or less homework?

Every assignment you issue is an assignment you’ll likely have to grade. Multiply that by the number of students you’re teaching and you may find, **just *grading alone,* homework may take hours, if not multiple work days, to accomplish.** 

Multiply that value again by the number of students who you have to rewrite the assignment for due to disabilities and accommodations. What seems like minor changes and a simple homework assignment inevitably scales exponentially as you have more students. Remember, time is your most valuable asset; you do not want to carelessly waste it.

**My opinion is do not give out homework you are not willing to grade, if you can help it.** If you do have to give out graded homework, figure out if there’s a way to automate or quickly accomplish the grading process. If you cannot automate it or quickly grade it, then see if you can structure or refine the assignment for more efficient grading, whether by limiting the number of questions or the types of responses permitted for questions.

Multiple choice questions, math/science problems with discrete solutions, and any questions with one solution work best here, because all you need to do is make a key and if their answers don’t make your answers, it’s easy to cross-reference and grade.

- In data analysis terms, it’s matching 1-to-1 questions to answers, rather than 1-to-many questions to answers.

These types of questions are easy to automate compared to qualitative problems and questions with a multitude/range of correct answers, which means you save more time. We like saving time.

The method I stuck with was “implied homework” for teaching, which meant explicitly telling students I’m putting the responsibility on them to properly prepare for tests, assignments, etc. based on any information and explanations I gave during classroom time. I told students what they’re expected to be tested on and what I’ll try to cover each unit. If I don’t go over a particular subject, then I figure out if there’s a way to summarize it and potentially exclude it from a unit’s exam. 

This setup got rid of virtually all of my homework, outside of math-heavy science and engineering topics, but vastly increased the number of “tests” I issued at the end of each unit in-class to compensate and ensure students properly prepared for and learned the appropriate subjects.

Another “implied” homework I gave, but didn’t explicitly grade, was allowing a “cheat sheet” for tests. This had varied results, so if I were to do it again I’d do the following:

- A notecard size at most. An entire page of 8.5 x 11 paper can fit in nearly entire exams if a student is willing to write small enough–and they most certainly are willing.
- Force it to be in writing. It forces students to commit to what they should put on a cheat sheet vs trying to remember, and stops the “copy+paste” problem of computer-based notes.

There’s cases where you can permit an open book test as well, but reserve those for topics with exceptional depth and where a student is better taught how to *find* things in the book(s) allowed for answers rather than knowing every detail in the book.

Overall though, don’t give out homework unless necessary. Try your best, as a teacher, to accomplish what you need to get students to learn within the classroom setting.
