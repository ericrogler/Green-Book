# Passporting & Information Transfer

### [Previous Chapter](Z015_Guest_Teachers_Presenters.html)

## **Short Answer**

Sometimes you need to help get a fellow teacher–or substitute teacher–set up in a classroom. You may not have to do it often, but it's better to know how because you may still need to do it.

## **Long Answer**

I'll split this up into two sections: teacher-to-teacher and teacher-to-substitute.

### **Teacher-to-Teacher**

Take, for example, a new employee is coming in, or a more seasoned one is transferring in for the first time. There's an orientation period where they're getting their bearings and understanding the environment. This general process isn't exclusive to teaching; you may see it in tech, nursing, and other jobs.

Pretend you are the older teacher, rather than a newer teacher. Here are things you may want your new junior to know and have, which may include the following:

- Contacts for other staff (emails, primarily).
- Building plans, or where things are located on the campus (like a coffee machine).
- How the printer/copier works.
- Where their office/classroom is.
- Technologies and learning systems the faculty use.
- Notes about any particular students to be mindful of.
- How to do shared planning and collaboration among staff members.
- Where to get resources for their class(es), whether electronic or physical.
- What you're doing to teach X subject (if both of you teach similar subjects).
    - You don't necessarily need to share your whole curriculum, but you can help the other teacher develop one over time.
- What to do in case of emergencies.
- Where are medical supplies.
- Guidelines on what other teachers should be allowed to help the new teacher with.
    - This is so a new teacher isn't too coddled and allowed to teach on their own.
- Any soft skills they should be mindful of.
- How to observe their classrooms (if needed).
- How to set up coverage (substitute teachers, etc.).
- How to build routines, establish behaviors and rewards, and management.
- Any plans for check-ins for newer teachers, like weekly meetings, collaboration sessions, etc.
- Ways to provide more time to "catch-up" on teaching duties.
- Class Schedules
- Who you're working with, whether it's by department, smaller group, etc.
- Access to the room(s) they’ll be using
- Sample Lesson Plans
- Instructions for grade/attendance/reporting system(s)
- What are the organizations new teachers need to interact with or have a line of communication with for parts of their curriculum

It's a long list, but keep in mind you'd want a teacher to stick around rather than muddle around and then depart. If you're able to get a new teacher who can stand on their own feet, then they will cause fewer issues for you as well. It's a mutual benefit for all involved. You could even include almost all of this on a single Google Document to distribute.

### **Teacher-to-Substitute**

For people taking over your class on days/times you're unavailable, it's more like you're giving them a laundry list of things to watch out for and how to manage that class. The rule of thumb is that the simpler the plan, the more likely it is to be followed.

It could be simple, like "here are the worksheets; make sure they do them," or something complex. Remember that whoever comes in as a substitute may not know your subject area, so plan accordingly. Your substitute may not even read your plans, which means you have to post the work online or distribute worksheets and hope the students complete the job.

Despite the simplicity, or complexity, of substitute plans, you'll want to make a "standard" template and an emergency substitute teacher plan. Emergency plans ensure you don't get in trouble when you can't create plans for a particular time frame. Substitute teachers may access information protected by FERPA/HIPAA so long as it pertains to your classroom. Still, they are on a "should know" basis rather than "may know."

Here are some things you should note down and divide by each class/subject for the times you are unavailable in these plans:

- A work plan of what the class is doing during the period(s).
- Any important notes about students.
    - E.g., Medication times, who has learning plans like IEP/504, etc.
- Noteworthy students with extra classroom roles, such as a student stepping up as a conductor in a music class or student assistants actively helping in the classroom.
- Any passwords, access codes, and permissions needed to run the classroom properly.
- Who to contact in case of emergencies/help.
- How the classroom is managed.
- Your email, or a way to contact you.
    - Avoid giving out your phone number unless that's your only contact.

**Example work plan for a given period:**

- Students do [Assignment] today.
    - Available on [Platform/Medium] located [Computer/Desk/Etc.].
    - Work is turned in [Online/Physical Location/Kept].
    - Expected to complete [In-Class/Out-of-Class/Partially done].
- Additional Resources: [Link(s)]
- If students finish all work early, have them do [other assignment(s)].

Only put down information relevant for a substitute teacher–or another teacher in general–to know for these plans when you're gone.
