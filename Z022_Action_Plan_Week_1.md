# 22. Action Plan: Week 1

### [Previous Chapter](Z021_Design_Systems_EdTech.html)

## **Short Answer**

*This period starts between before day 1 to end of week 1.*

If you're limited on preparation time, focus on setting up classroom management and procedures, followed by syllabus and lesson plans.

You may need to spend time outside of work to get everything done. In this first week, that is perfectly OK. If you invest the proper time planning *now* and set up your systems early on, even if they're basic scaffolds, then you save significant time later on.

**If this is your first year teaching, you're going to struggle with management. That's not meant to scare you off, but a lot of people falsely assume teachers just teach and that couldn't farther from the truth.**
- The first year for many jobs typically involves struggling, which is normal, but especially so with teaching.
- *This is why I made several chapters dedicated to management alone in a teaching/instructional book!*
- Do not be everything to everyone; focus on teaching and managing students.

## **Long Answer**

***Two assumptions in place:***
1. *Designed for a year-long (or semester-long) class session taking place at a physical location for primary or secondary education.*
2. *You have at least a few days to 1 week BEFORE class starts for preparation.*

The very first day of a classroom setting. Depending on your timeframe, like if your entire curriculum is one day long, what you need prepared may change.

If you only have a few prep days, focus on lesson plans, syllabus, classroom procedures and rules, and basic supplies. This is so you're not scrambling last minute and other things can be figured out during breaks.

If you can only do one thing, then do classroom procedures and rules. Drill students on what to do when X situation arises, or how to do specific tasks the way you want, and have them do it on their own without reminders every time. It will help you immensely with classroom management in the future.

**Here are some things I'd like to have (and/or know) by week 1.** I'm focusing on the bare essentials over "nice to haves" to balance preparedness with minimal cost and effort, plus the ability to address many situations:
- Facility access, like keys and scannable ID badge
- Parking space (if applicable)
- Assigned classroom(s) locations
- Building layout map
- Work contacts, like principal, support staff, other teachers in the department, etc.
- A syllabus
- Basic supplies: markers, pencils, pens, paper, sticky notes, rulers, etc.
- Lesson plan for the day and/or first week
- List of standards and objectives for your class(es) taught
- Classroom procedures and rules
- Seating assignments (if applicable)
- Cleaning supplies
- Desks and chairs (if applicable)
- Function utilities (HVAC, sinks, fridges, ovens, etc.)
- School and/or class schedule
- List of students for the class(es)
- Account information for computers, payroll systems, work emails, etc.
- Specialist supplies (for subject-specific needs)
  - E.g., a class on medicine may need medical supplies ready on day 1
- First Aid Kit (FAK)
- Something to carry your supplies around
  - Backpack, binder, etc.
- Locations of critical areas on campus, such as lounge, fridge, bathrooms, front office, and nurse's office
- List of software and other tools you need for class on the first day
- N95 and KN95 (or higher grade) masks
- Some snacks hidden away. You never know when you might want a little snacky snack.
  - E.g. I mathed out one of my desk drawers was large enough to stow away a 6-pack box of donuts from Safeway and King Soopers.

Think of it like climbing a plateau. It is steep initially, but once you reach the top, it flattens out and is easier to traverse. Not every item may be needed, but this serves as a baseline. 

### **Making Adjustments**

There's a chance you find out, probably the hard way, you'll need to do things differently to meet student needs and accommodations.

Firstly, don't panic yet. That's normal to not have *everything* line up with expectations.

Now that you've avoided panic (hopefully), it's not the end of the world. The first week is used for sorting out the classroom environment and starting up curricula, so sorting out feasible adjustments *now* works in your favor. 

Here's a quick deduction process you can do:
- Figure out and define the problem(s)
- Determine any blockers, if any, to solve the problems
- Refine the problem set to focus on specific problems you *can* solve
- Formulate many possible solutions (at first)
- Refine the solutions until you're at the minimum number of solutions needed to solve all problems

For those in the designer workspace, this may look familar to the Double Diamond framework. That's intentional, as you're also exploring what the problems are and potential solutions to those problems here too.

### **Syllabus**
A syllabus is essential information for the student to know about in your class. Depending on student demographics, this can be either simple or more complex in design.

This may include, but is not limited to:
- Learning objectives and goals
- Grades/grading distribution
- Late work policies
- Absences
- Exam schedule
- Course content outline
- Classroom schedule & meeting times
- Required materials and account information
  - For physical textbooks, online programs, etc.
- Payment methods, payment plans, and monetary costs (if applicable)
- Overview of classroom procedures and rules

The syllabus isn't a legal document, but it must be accessible and clear to students taking your course(s).

### **Lesson Plan**

Lesson plans are a roadmap and a written record of what you're teaching. They keep you on track, provide documentation to show "proof of learning" if disputes arise, and outline methods used to teach your material. 

A lesson plan can include lectures, activities, projects, material covered on X day/week, tests, quizzes, field trips, and more.

### **Classroom Procedures and Rules**

These are what you want students to do automatically and correctly without much intervention from you.

To give some examples of procedures to cover:
- What students should do when they enter a room
- Taking attendance
- Where to turn in work
- What to do when teacher(s) not present in the room
- Transitioning between rooms/periods
- Quieting the room to redirect attention
- Where classroom supplies go and their use

Good procedures reduce management overhead and enforce *knowing* what to do, rather than using up extra time to *think* about what to do. Many procedures are only effective if enforced consistently as well, so don't assume students know and teach explicitly what you need them to learn.

If, by your choice or not by your choice, you *have* to start on material day 1 or 2 regardless of whatever else happens, spend as much of day 1 as possible going over classroom procedures to ensure students know how to function inside your classroom.

**As a final warning: do not assume that because everything *looked* like it went well, that it actually went well.** If even one mistake or detail goes wrong, reteach and remind as soon as possible or you risk your classroom management plan falling apart.

### **First Aid Kit (FAK)**

*Disclaimer: Not medical advice. Consult professionals for medical guidance.*

I've been pleasantly surprised how often a FAK was necessary, even for minor injuries and the occasional request for a bandage. Most information for a FAK can be found online across multiple, credible sources like MedlinePlus and American Red Cross.

You may also see different types of medical kits, such as bleeding control or trauma kits, in addition to first aid kits. I'm focusing on first aid kits here because each type of medical kit, while essential and helpful, serves different functions and are not necessarily interchangeable.

For legal reasons, teachers may not administer drugs to students, except under rare, narrowly defined, and explict scenarios. These restricted drugs include, but are not limited to:
- Ointments (Vaseline and Neosporin)
- Pain Medicine (Tylenol, Advil, Ibuprofen, etc.)
  - Hospitals and medical facilities track their use through acetaminophen ("Tylenol") levels
  - It can be difficult to find how much acetaminophen you did take and overdosing can cause liver damage or death (MedlinePlus, 2023)
  - You're very unlikely to have medicine, such as acetylcysteine, as antidotes for any issues like overdosing.
- Creams, lotions, and medicated wipes

**An overdose, even accidental, is a medical emergency that you do not want to cause, or be responsible for, and can lead to death.**

Some items are in a grey area, such as disinfectants and antiseptic wipes. For those, confirm with a principal, administrator, and/or nursing staff first before using, and also confirm the cases where it can be used.

You may also consider a bottle of peppermint concentrate/oil/extract. You can safely avoid that because the likelihood you deal with a foul smell on the level of putrescine or cadaverine in your work setting is extremely low.

**Non-drug items I find typically safe for classroom First Aid Kits (FAKs):**
- Bandages
- Sharpie markers
- Scissors/Shears (blunt or rounded tip preferred)
- Tweezers
- Disposable Nitrile Gloves
- Thermal/Rescue Blanket
- Cold Compress
- Medical Tape
- Gauze (Plain, Pad/Square, and/or Roller)

These are items I would expect many people, including students, to utilize with manageable risk. Adapt the list as needed.

Other medical items, like tourniquets and chest seals, don't administer drugs but require training to avoid life-threatening misuse. Though more workplaces in 2025 have better medical training for staff, high stress situations can still impair judgment and increase accidental risk.
- You can safely include more items, provided you're trained and understand how to use them.
- As an example of training, the [U.S. Department of Defense has a nationwide "STOP THE BLEED" program](https://www.dodstopthebleed.org/) for bleeding control.

There's also two other rules of thumb for FAKs I prefer to follow:
1. Review FAKs each year and discard any expired items; many medical items have shelf lives of only 1 to 5+ years (American Red Cross, 2024).
2. When you're experienced enough, create your own first aid kit(s) based on specific needs. This helps you know what supplies are in the kit, where they're located, and lower patient response times.
