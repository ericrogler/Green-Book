# Analysis (for Instructors)

### [Previous Chapter](Z007y_Probability_And_Statistics.html)

## **Short Answer**

*Notice: This entire chapter is, at best, a surface level view of each topic covered here. That is intentional.*

To encourage people to care about your research, analysis, etc. you must address the questions they need answered. This typically means a clear question with actionable items and inquiring what information needs to be found and used for decisions. 

Most analysis will employ tools, such as software like Excel or a coding language, as your primary means to figure out the answer(s). You'll also find data excels at humbling people and exposing what is *really* happening.

Sometimes analysis and modeling doesn't requiring any math. In fact, it may be counterintuitive to write an entire, custom solution when an existing model you can import solves the problem far faster and more accurately. There's also countless business problems requiring advanced, custom analytics, which means you need statistics and math.

Statistical Significance does not imply Practical Significance.

## **Long Answer**

You may be wondering why a book on teaching and instruction dedicated so much time to math.

The reason is simple: you need to know math to understand educational research which influences *every field.* How to read information and communicate findings is critical. Communication is already a skill you should be doing well as a teacher/instructor (assuming the person reading this *is* one, right?).

Now we go onto analysis; an application of all that math with some science and social skills.

The good news about data analysis is you don't *need* a lot of math skills to interpret results. You can see this best through visuals like infographs, dashboards, and more. You still need to know the context behind numbers though.

The bad news about data analysis is you need a lot of math skills to get the most out of data and generate effective results.

In other words: *Learn Math.*

I will cater this chapter towards readers of lower math levels, but I'll stress foundational knowledge is required to fully understand everything presented here. I won't handhold you here. 
- No, this isn't going to be the average professional development course expressing "you need data." You don't need hard data for every problem; that's stupid and unrealistic.
- If appropriate, expect me to link out information to more detailed explanations on topics.

### **Data Analysis Primer**

**There's three "laws" of data:**
1. Data are objective. Interpretation is subjective.
2. You can tell whatever story you want with data, if you know how to, for both good and evil.
3. Numbers/data without context are useless.

A lot of analysis isn't really designing the fancy dashboard or displaying results for clients. That's still an important part though because an interface which looks good also affects the perception of it. It still must answer a specific question, or set of questions, someone has when looking through it.

Most analysis comes from cleaning up data, understanding your user's (or student's) needs, understanding business objectives, actually analyzing the data, and storytelling. In other words, you're paving the wa

The previous three topics, which are Calculus, Probability, and Statistics, are also important because they open up the way to understanding further advanced topics like optimization, linear (and nonlinear) programming, forecasting, regression, and more.

### **The Power of Spreadsheets/Tables**

*Alternatively: The Power of Databases*

This is talking about programs like Excel, Google Spreadsheets, etc.

If someone tells you Excel is a database, you have my permission to ignore everything else they say when it comes to understanding technology.

Harsh as that sounds, you have tools built for analysis and tools build for storing information into databases. A database is
