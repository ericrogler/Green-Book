# Analysis (for Instructors)

### [Previous Chapter](Z007y_Probability_And_Statistics.html)

## **Short Answer**

WIP

*Notice: This entire chapter is, at best, a surface level view of each topic covered here. That is intentional.*

Broken record reminder: you'll still want advanced knowledge precisely to know when an advanced method is not the best course of action and to know how to manipulate advanced methods to better suit your needs.

## **Long Answer**

The good news about data analysis is you don't need a lot of math skills to interpret results. You can see this best through results displayed visuals like infographs, dashboards, and more. You still need context behind numbers, however.

The bad thing about data analysis is you need a lot of math skills to get the most out of data and generate effective results.

In other words: *Learn Math.*

I will cater this chapter towards readers of lower math levels, but I'll stress foundational knowledge is required to fully understand everything presented here. I won't handhold you here. 
- No, this isn't going to be the average professional development course expressing "you need data." You don't need hard data for every problem; that's stupid and unrealistic.
- If appropriate, expect me to link out information to more detailed explanations on topics.

### **Data Analysis Primer**

**There's three "laws" of data:**
1. Data is objective. Interpretation is subjective.
2. You can tell whatever story you want with data, if you know how to, for both good and evil.
3. Numbers/Data without context are useless.

A lot of analysis isn't really designing the fancy dashboard or displaying results for clients. That's still an important part though because an interface which looks good also affects the perception of it. It still must answer a specific question, or set of questions, someone has when looking through it.

Most analysis comes from cleaning up data, understanding your user's (or student's) needs, understanding business objectives, actually analyzing the data, and storytelling. In other words, you're paving the wa

The previous three topics, which are Calculus, Probability, and Statistics, are also important because they open up the way to understanding further advanced topics like optimization, linear (and nonlinear) programming, forecasting, regression, and more.

### **The Power of Spreadsheets**

This is talking about programs like Excel, Google Spreadsheets, etc.
