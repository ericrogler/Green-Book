## **Short Answer**

You still have more duties to take care of and many of them are not teaching related.

## **Long Answer**

Depending on your assignment, you may have work outside of teaching the subjects you were hired on to teach. This can include, but are not limited to:

- General school duties
- Proctoring
- Hall duty
- After and before school duty
- Lunch / meal duty
- PIC (person-in-charge) for events
- Chaperone
- Homeroom teacher
- Extra-curriculars
- Field trips
- Community service
- Marketing materials
- Student supervision (outside of typical classroom supervision as teacher)
- Substitute Teaching (as a teacher)
- Mandatory Reporter

Not every teacher has to do ALL of these, but there’s a high chance you’ll do at least 1 of these, if not several, during your tenure.

Most of these are self explanatory (e.g. lunch duty = duties you have to follow during lunch time, etc.), while others aren’t as obvious.

**Homeroom teachers** are the primary teachers for specific grade levels–or groups of students–and differ from general subject teachers. The exact duties of a homeroom teacher vary from school to school, but it’s where some administrative tasks, such as attendance, lunch money, announcements, flyers, and managing supplies are likely handled. The groups meeting their homeroom teachers are typically at the start, or end, of a school day. It’s not too different from teaching like normal, but you’re also a point of contact for parents, staff, and more for the students assigned under you and may need to go to meetings with non-students concerning your students.

**Extracurriculars** are what I’ll say is “anything that is not taught in a standard curriculum.” These are clubs, athletic groups, organizations, etc. Each of these clubs has at least one adult present amongst all students, acting as the supervisor/organizer and point of contact. For certain activities, like sports, you don’t necessarily need a teacher to be a coach; it can be any vetted adult by the school or educational facility permitting the adult to act as a coach for them. Most of the time, though, teachers from your school or institution are supervisors and contacts for extracurriculars. You employ similar tactics to teaching, but aren’t necessarily confined to a strict curriculum like traditional teaching, or your goal is to do an activity, such as chess club. The tips you know for managing students apply here, and you’re still responsible for students under your care at these extracurriculars.

**Field trips** are part “in the name” and part deceptively simple. If you’ve ever planned a vacation before and it involves overnight stays in a different area, or flying over to a different state or country, a lot of stuff there also applies to field trips here. Outside of vacations you may or may not be used to, field trips require a significant amount of time to prepare beforehand because you need some things before you even go on a trip.

- The funding necessary for the trip
- Appropriate accommodations
- An explicit list of students going on the trip
- Permission forms signed by parents/students
- Waivers (if applicable) signed by parents/students
- Securing a means of travel
- Securing a means of staying overnight (if applicable)
- Convincing the principal and other administration to approve it
- Adjusting the curriculum to accommodate the field trip

There’s other factors depending on your exact situation, such as what is allowed by the administration, who explicitly can and cannot go on trips, and more I won’t list here. Field trips may occur as a part of club or extra-curricular activities, but also by general subject classrooms. The biggest blocker to field trips is acquiring permission from parents/guardians (unless the student is of age to sign the forms in place of parents/guardians) as well as administration. Other likely blockers are not having enough funds, or not having a means of transportation.

In the United States, means of transportation are interesting–and surprisingly strict–for teachers. **In secondary and primary education (high school and below), you may not, as a teacher, operate a vehicle with any students inside of it.** There are very rare exceptions where you *can* do this, but it requires both paperwork and legal liability coverage, which you’re highly unlikely to have, and, even if you do have it, it’s not worth risking the litigation over unless it is a dire emergency and you are in constant communication with a principal and communicated with a parent during the transportation.

What this vehicle restriction means for you, as a teacher, is all methods of transportation need to be covered by vetted adults, like student parents with appropriate background checks, or a paid out transportation service like a shuttle or bus. This includes land, sea, and air, as well as space in the far future.

**Proctoring** is when you’re observing students taking a test. This is typically done through state standard tests, college admission tests like ACT and SAT, advanced tests like AP and IB, online proctor testing, and traditional room/exam hall testing. For traditional testing and tests for subjects in your own classroom you teach in, you define how you monitor student activity, what is allowed, and what is not allowed. For tests used to transfer into higher education or state assessments, a guide is provided to you on how you monitor students taking the test, including when to do each part, the time allotted for each part, when breaks are given, and how students and desks are arranged in the testing area. Proctoring isn't too difficult, from personal experience, but it requires vigilance and monitoring throughout the entire testing period.

**Substitute teaching** can be assumed by a separate substitute teacher, or by a current teacher at the institution doing it for you for a time. Sometimes, as a current teacher, you may need to sub in for another teacher at the same location. The teacher you’re subbing in for should have left you a plan, if not emergency plans at least, for you to follow. As long as you follow those plans, you’re generally in good shape. If there are *no* plans left at all, refer to support staff in the area, if present, for assistance.
