# Other Additional Duties

### [Previous Chapter](Z016_Passporting_Information_Transfer.html)

## **Short Answer**

You may still have more duties to take care of and many of them are not teaching-related.

## **Long Answer**

Depending on your assignment, you may have work outside of teaching your assigned subjects. This can include, but is not limited to:

**Campus Duties**

- Hall duty
- Lunch/meal duty 
- Before/after school duty

**Instructional Duties**

- Proctoring
- Substitute Teaching (as a teacher)
- Homeroom teacher

**Student Activity Responsibilities**
- Chaperone
- Extra-curriculars
- Field trips
- Community service

**Administrative Tasks**
- Mandatory Reporter
- Marketing materials
- PIC (point of contact) for events

Not every teacher has to do ALL of these, but there's a high chance you'll do at least 1 of these, if not several, during your tenure.

Most of these are self-explanatory (e.g., lunch duty = duties you have to follow during lunch time, etc.), while others aren't as obvious.

**Homeroom teachers** are the primary teachers for specific grade levels–or groups of students–and differ from general subject teachers. The exact duties of a homeroom teacher vary from school to school. It's where many administrative tasks may be handled related to students.

The groups meeting their homeroom teachers are typically at the start or end of the school day. You're also a point of contact for parents, staff, and more for the students assigned to you, and you may need to attend meetings with non-students concerning your students.

**Extracurriculars** are what I'll say is anything not a part of standard curriculums. These are clubs, athletic groups, organizations, etc. There's one or more adults present amongst all students acting as supervisor and point of contact. For certain activities, like sports, you don't necessarily need a current teacher to be a coach; it could be any vetted adult by the school or educational facility. You employ similar tactics to teaching, but your goal is to excel in an activity, such as a chess club.

**Field trips** are part "in the name" and part deceptively simple. Field trips require a significant amount of time to prepare beforehand to sort things such as getting enough funds, permissions from guardians/parents, administrative approvals, and transportation/lodging arrangements. Other factors depend on your exact situation which I won't list here.

In the United States, means of transportation are interesting–and surprisingly strict–for teachers. **Teachers may not transport students in personal vehicles due to liability issues outside of rare, pre-approved emergencies.** Due to this restriction, all transportation must be handled by vetted adults by the school or contracted services like buses, shuttles, boats, planes, and trains.

**Proctoring** is when you're observing students taking a test and is typically done through state standard tests, college admission tests like ACT and SAT, advanced tests like AP and IB, online proctor testing, and traditional room/exam hall testing.

For traditional testing and tests for subjects in your classroom, you define how you monitor student activity, what is allowed, and what is not allowed. 

For tests used to transfer into higher education or state assessments, expect a proctor guide on how to monitor students taking the test, including the test schedule, time allotments, break schedules, and the arrangement of students and desks in the testing area. 

**Substitute teaching** can be assumed by a separate substitute teacher, or by a current teacher at the institution doing it for you for a time. In general, follow the provided plans and ask support staff for guidance if needed.
