## **Short Answer**

I’m not a proponent of “individual learning styles” ([**see here for further evidence**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249039450_The_Myth_of_Learning_Styles)). There are optimal ways to learn topics, but the best way varies from topic to topic and you can teach in multiple ways at once. Direct instruction is an effective way of learning, if done well.

- As an example, you can watch 10000 hours of violin playing, but it won’t make you a virtuoso. 10000 hours of practicing violin playing will get you far closer to a virtuoso.

I’d personally recommend some form of learning with a combination of the following involved for students:

- Getting enough sleep
- Spaced Practice
- Interleaved Practice
- Varied Practice
- Experiencing and working through failure

## **Long Answer**

There are multiple ways to go through learning. A more common method is the [**Feynman technique**](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/), where you learn by selecting a concept and trying to explain it in simple terms. Another method is through flashcards with the [**Leitner system**](https://www.k-state.edu/aac/success-tools/collection/Leitner_System.pdf) or [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

If you have ever coached or practiced sports before, you may have experienced spaced practice, interleaved practice, and varied practice but not know there were terms for it.

Sleep is important. Both students and teachers should not neglect it because it affects learning. How exactly sleep affects learning is outside the scope of this writing, but generally speaking: if you don’t get enough sleep, it is harder to learn and keep up learning over a long time.

### Types of Practice

**Spaced practice** (alternatively, “distributed practice”) is the most straight-forward. Rather than learning and cramming everything at once, you do the same material over multiple, *spaced*, time periods. There is a strong emphasis on long enough breaks between the time you first learn material, followed by reviewing the material; the optimal point to relearn is somewhere around where you’re just about to forget information. It’s used to combat the [**forgetting curve**](https://e-student.org/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve/) to help with active recall and better memory retention of the topic(s) learned.

Before going into the next type of practice, I’ll review “massed practice” next. Massed practice is the opposite of spaced practice. Rather than giving time and learning over multiple sessions, you try to learn everything in a single session (or multiple, unspaced sessions) and hope the information sticks. That may work for Tony Stark when it comes to thermonuclear astrophysics, but for 99.9% of other students, that statistically does not work.

- If it *does* seem to work, it’s an illusion of effective learning and there’s a high chance you’ll forget it all in a day, if not a week, after your learning session(s).

**Interleaved practice** is when you alternate what is being practiced or learned. For example, we spaced out tennis practice at certain times each day as spaced practice. Interleaved practice is doing multiple types of tennis techniques throughout the practice sessions, rather than only drop shots one day and back hands only the next; the day can *interleave* drop shots and back hand returns together in the same session.

**Varied practice** is another form of learning. To expand on the tennis example, we’re already doing spaced days and interleaving different types of tennis techniques throughout the day. However, now we *vary* the context of the techniques and how they are used. Do you use a drop shot when at the back of the court? What about the technique to use when you’re suddenly near the net? You take the topic and the techniques employed under that topic and vary up on how they’re applied and when they’re applied.

### Helplessness and Failure

Lastly, there’s also dealing with the theories of learned helplessness, learned incompetence, and negative reinforcement. It may show at any age in humans and also shows up in animals, but typically shows up in younger age groups. In the context of students, these issues manifest most often when a student is presented with a difficult task. Rather than try to work through a task to the best of their ability, they may instead not attempt the task at all because it seems difficult or attempt it once and give up after only a single failure, waiting for someone else to do the work for them.

In teaching, these three concepts are surprisingly prevalent and can show up in many, unexpected ways. Here are some examples:

- Student doesn’t have a pencil? They may sit there until you give them a pencil, rather than searching for a pencil, to start work.
- Students have to retake a test? They may not care enough, despite repeated classwide reminders, or even a 1-on-1 reminder. Even if it is important, they may still avoid it and not care enough to do it.
- Students need to practice a new skill? They may refuse to do it because they don’t know how to do it.

Ironically, the easiest way for them to get used to failure is to force them to confront failure when it occurs rather than sidestep it. You may also see this with working adults too: doing just enough work to not get fired, because they have seen good workers be rewarded with more work to do. Depending on your school environment, this may be frowned upon or, worse, get you a stern talking to and other trouble because some institutions won’t allow you to “fail” students. If you’re not allowed to fail students, how will students ever experience failure to then learn to overcome it?

A reason why the teacher may avoid failing students is because of the amount of paperwork, legal and otherwise, required. Many teachers are subject to this paperwork requirement, while some may not be.

To illustrate: If a student gets a passing grade, despite it being a low passing grade, they’re fine. If a student gets a failing grade, however, you may have to show proof of failure solely on the students part and you took every appropriate measure to try and teach the material to them to no avail. Ironically, the burden of proof is on you, the teacher, and not the student to show that the student did fail on their own merit. A method teachers employ to avoid failure is to provide enough points to “push along” the student into the next grade or out of the class. This may be due to their own sympathies for students or due to administration not allowing them to fail students and pass everyone unless extreme circumstances, like blatant cheating, show otherwise.

Many students can act like they don’t know because it’s easier to do so and it has worked for them before. If you can throw the accountability onto them and ensure they have the tools they need to complete the work–preferably with a method your superiors are approving of–then you can show proof of you doing your due diligence in case anyone asks about student issues later on.

Countering learned helplessness, faked incompetence, and negative reinforcement is simple: Do not help students unless absolutely needed and/or medically/legally obligated to. It’s the best way I’ve seen it beat those issues; making students experience and overcome difficulty and failure.

### Performance vs Learning

When a student focuses on performance, their goal is to satisfy metrics–often quantitative, like a grade–and do no additional work beyond that. When a student focuses on learning, they’ll invest time less towards an explicit grade and more towards the underlying how and/or why something works. 

Ironically, students I’ve seen focused on learning score similar, if not higher, grades compared to students focused on performance. They’re exploring the topic they’re tested on in-depth rather than a baseline effort to achieve a desired grade and no more beyond that.

If you’re still unsure what to tell students when it comes to learning, I’ll give you a list I’ve shown to my own students. It’s a rather long list, so you may do all the points or cherry-pick the points most relevant to your situation.

- Learning well requires going beyond passively learning about topics
- If you cannot solve problems or recall facts in practice, it’s improbable to do so during a test (or applied scenario)
- The best methods are organic, but counterintuitive
    - What seems easy for learning may not help you learn as well
- Frustrations and difficulties are expected
- Better learning can be achieved at little to no additional cost
- Better to try and guess than give up
- Learning is not always fun or easy
- There’s two ways of learning: the explanation/theory and the practice. Both are necessary.
- Massed practice provides a false sense of mastery
- Handwriting helps with retention more than typing
- Stating a concept verbally does not necessarily equal mastery of a concept
- People like success, so people avoid challenging problems/failure
- Some people place social acceptance high above the need to learn and understand information
- Helping out people who struggle too much is detrimental to them
- Goals matter more when chosen by someone rather than given
