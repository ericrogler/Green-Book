# The Actual Overview

### [Navigation & ReadMe](README.md)

### [Previous Chapter](Z001_Manager_TLDR.md)

## **My Role & Time**

- Duration: 2 years
- Role: Teacher (In-Person, NOT Online)
- School Types: Secondary and Primary Education; public & private schools

## **Introduction**

Imagine I need to get a new teacher, instructor, presenter, etc. from 0-100 as fast as possible, WITHOUT giving them any additional materials to copy+paste and they’re in a situation where they start from… well, basically nothing.

**That’s my problem here to solve and this writing is my solution. I take what seems complex and make it simpler to approach in an accessible way.**

Think of this writing as the starting point. If you need to learn or expand on a topic, you’ll have an idea *which* topic to further learn about rather than be completely aimless.

A teacher exists in many different forms. There’s the formal teacher many students are familiar with, but there’s also teachers in unexpected places. Perhaps you’ve shown someone how to ride a bicycle, operate a piece of software, or assist in interpreting a book passage. All those, and countless other examples, have you teaching.

Because a teacher exists in many different forms, they can come from many backgrounds. A data engineer may create a guide discussing ETL and data cleaning, a designer may touch upon Gestalt Principles and accessibility, and an architect may explain to their friends why they use a 2x6 wall over a 2x4 wall on bathroom walls where the shower line is installed (hint: it’s easy for plumbing and weather-proofing).

Everyone can teach. You may not need to condense an entire PhD and graduate thesis into 2 sentences to explain a topic, but if you can communicate a topic you know to another person, and they can understand it, you’re capable of teaching someone.

### **Audience**

This writing is designed with the following people in mind:

- Teachers starting out
- People in instructional roles (formally or not) with no idea where to start
- Teachers with limited time (<2 weeks) to set up an entire new course to teach (my case)
- People teaching online and/or outside of traditional classroom settings
- People teaching in traditional classroom settings
- People with non-teaching backgrounds and multi-disciplinary backgrounds
- A student wondering why their teacher is doing things a certain way
- Hiring managers not wanting to read the entire thing and just get an overview

### **Assumptions / Advisory for Readers**

*The frameworks and advice given assume the following is true for the reader’s case:*

- Some statements and information may not be independently verifiable because it relies on internal evidence like grades, timelines, surveys, and more. Some information I cannot openly share legally and other information I purposely omit PID/PII.
- **You are hired on as a teacher, able to be hired into an instructional role (not necessarily a “Teacher” title), OR you are in a role where you design learning materials and curriculums in general.**
    - **This means I’m not covering how to get a teaching license–or other licenses–extensively as it’s a varied, case-by-case basis.**
- The frameworks and advice I give are originally designed for technical classes, such as math, engineering, and science.
    - If able, I’ll call out potential adjustments for other subject areas.
- You are dealing with reasonable students.
    - This is purposely vague and depends on what type of group is being taught.
    - Think of “normal expectations” for your area, industry, behaviors, etc.
- Students are capable of performing work when given by a teacher.
- Up to moderate disabilities are present in some, but not the majority, of students.
- The reader does not require a special background or expertise to implement the advice and strategies discussed here.
- Many “results” I talk about are from direct observations over the years I’ve taught and are difficult to quantify outside of estimations when you’re doing multiple tasks at once and cannot treat the classroom like a user research session.
    - Additionally, using data from my students may introduce two types of bias from non-probability sampling: voluntary response and convenience.
- For any products I call out and examples from those products, I am not endorsing or saying you need to purchase/use those products. They are there because I used them and thought they had value to me when I taught.
