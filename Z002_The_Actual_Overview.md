# The Actual Overview

### [Previous Chapter](Z001_Manager_TLDR.html)

## **My Role Overview**

For authenticity purposes as needed.

- **Duration:** 2.5+ years (2022-2025+)
- **Role:** STEM Teacher (In-Person, NOT Online), with some time as a substitute teacher.
- **Main School Types:** Secondary and primary education; public & private schools

## **Introduction**

Imagine I need to get a new teacher, instructor, presenter, etc. from 0-100 as fast as possible, without giving them any additional materials to copy and paste. They're in a situation where they start from, well, basically nothing.

**That's my problem here to solve and this book is my solution. I take what seems complex and make it more accessible. For this purpose, this book is an INTRODUCTORY text and will not cover every possible edge case.**

***Think of this book as the BLÅHAJ to your IKEA.*** 

It's the companion covering your essentials and a breadth of information over various topics to establish a starting point. From here, if you need to learn more about, or expand on, a topic, you'll have an idea *which* topic to further learn about rather than be completely aimless.

A teacher exists in many different forms. There's the formal teacher many students are familiar with, but there are also teachers in unexpected places. Perhaps you've shown someone how to ride a bicycle, operate a piece of software, or help interpret a book passage. All those, and countless other examples, are taught by you as you assume the role of a teacher.

Because a teacher exists in many different forms, they can come from many backgrounds. A data engineer may create a guide discussing ETL and data cleaning, a designer may touch upon Gestalt Principles and accessibility, and an architect may explain to their friends why they use a 2x6 wall over a 2x4 wall on bathroom walls where the shower line is installed (hint: it's easy for plumbing and weather-proofing).

Everyone can teach. If you can communicate a topic you know to another person, and they can understand it, you're capable of teaching someone.

### **Audience**

This book caters to the following people in mind:

- Teachers starting out
- People in instructional roles (formally or not) with no idea where to start
- Teachers with limited time (<2 weeks) to set up an entire new course to teach (my case)
- People teaching online and/or outside of traditional classroom settings
- People teaching in traditional classroom settings
- People with non-teaching backgrounds and multi-disciplinary backgrounds
- A student wondering why their teacher is doing things a certain way
- Hiring managers curious about teaching
- Non-technical readers unfamiliar with teacher terminology

### **Additional Assumptions and Advisory for Readers**

- **This book is intended for educational and informational purposes.**
- Some statements and information may not be independently verifiable because they rely on internal evidence like grades, timelines, surveys, and more. This info I cannot openly share legally and I have to purposely omit personal identifying information.
- You may be in an instructional role, formally or not, or design learning materials and curricula.
    - This means I won't cover getting teaching licenses in-depth.
- Frameworks written here are primarily designed for teaching technical subjects (math, engineering, science, etc.). Adjustments are called out if relevant and feasible.
- You are dealing with reasonable students capable of completing assigned work.
    - This is purposely vague and depends on audience.
    - Think of "normal expectations" for your area, industry, behaviors, etc.
- Up to minor to moderate disabilities are present in some, but not the majority, of students.
- You do not require a special background to implement advice and strategies discussed here.
- Many "results" are based on direct observation and estimations rather than controlled observations. It's hard to do data collection while teaching simultaneously.
    - Student data may introduce two types of bias from non-probability sampling: voluntary response and convenience.
- References to products or tools are not endorsements. They're included because they were useful in writing this book and/or for when I taught.
- Sources used are listed and divided into each chapter's respective bibliography.
    - Sources are directly cited if I'm quoting challengeable text, numbers, figures, etc. or linking directly to text to explain a point.
    - There may be indirect citations if I can cite, in-text, a link directly to the source(s) for reference or further reading. (e.g. "Here's a [blank hyperlink]() showcasing X idea." and "Here's an idea ([Further Reading](https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/revit-subscription-faq))")
