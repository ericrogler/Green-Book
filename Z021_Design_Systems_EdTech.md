# Design Systems and EdTech

### [Previous Chapter](Z020_The_Use_Of_AI.html)

## **Short Answer**

Everyone is a designer. Not everyone is a good designer though.

Understanding design systems translates directly into skills across multiple fields and helps with templating, creating reusable components and materials, and making it easy to change things.

Learn to not fall in love with your work, because high chances are you will change it later.

## **Long Answer**

Considering all the other topics and themes in the book, I get the feeling some readers think I’m pulling a Kansas City Shuffle on them. To that I say: you’re right, but also wrong. 

I’ve lived in Kansas City and can tell you about gas station barbecue, amongst other things, no problem. I’ll also tell you I’m not talking about Kansas City, MO, but instead Kansas City, KS.

Moving on though.

### The Weird Complexity of Design Systems

Per Chad Bergman on Figma’s blog (**[Further Reading](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-systems-101-what-is-a-design-system/#what-exactly-is-a-design-system)**):

> A design system is a set of building blocks and standards that help keep the look and feel of products and experiences consistent.

For those with less artistic backgrounds or lacking design skills, don’t worry. You don’t need to design things, but I will ask you to see what a design system is and what it tries to accomplish.

If you’re ever played with Legos, used power tools for construction, or question why you keep losing the 10mm socket for bolts and nuts used across various products, you’re dealing with something akin to a design system.

Done correctly, **a design system accomplishes several goals**:
- A single source of truth
- Contains standards, rules, styles, etc. you can look up and follow
- Collection of libraries hosting your building blocks
- Consistency across all your products and works
- Redundancy and time spent designing reduced
- Higher ease of access to newer and experienced personnel

**Design systems are utilized in three ways: Adopt, Adapt, Create.**

**Adopting takes a design system and adds it into your current system(s) without changes.** It doesn’t always replace an existing system, but it does have to go into an existing workflow.
- To give an example, you’re taking a cake recipe you found in a book and introducing it as a new item, as is, without changing it. 

**Adapting takes a design system and changes parts and pieces to fit it into existing system(s).**
- Continuing from the cake example: you find a cake recipe in a book and follow its steps closely, but you need to substitute the flour for a gluten-free alternative to satisfy the needs of employees, users, etc.

**Creating borrows from no design system and creates a new system from scratch.** You can still reference other design systems to create your own, but you’re not taking any existing products and modifying them. You’re going from 0-100 (or close to it).
- You looked around the Internet for cake recipes, but didn’t see any you liked. Making an educated guess (and perhaps doing research/testing), you create your own cake recipe, deciding its process and ingredients, to sell to consumers.

Adopting, adapting, and creating each have their own benefits and drawbacks. This isn’t limited to just design systems; it can go across processes of many kinds and software you use too. Adopting is the least costly (usually), but offers less customization, while creating is the most costly, whether in time and/or money, but offers high customization to stand out more. Adapting is somewhere in between adopting and creating, depending on what and how much you’re adapting from design systems.

If you’re unsure whether to adopt, adapt, or create, consider the amount of creative freedom or control you need over your system. Adopting suits interests best when you don’t need to make many edits, but creating suits interests best when you’re expecting to make multiple customizations and adjustments over time.

### How Design Systems Relate Back to Teaching

Think of design systems as curriculums. Let me draw some parallels below:
- Both have well-defined standards to follow
- Both contain (hopefully) a library of resources to create your own materials and reproduce them
- Both have ways to edit foundational elements and components to do a service
- Both offer options for templates, patterns, components, and tokens
- Both are organized into a clear hierarchy of topics/components
- Both offer ways for handling different types of media and information delivery
- Both permit edits from multiple people, which applies to all materials within the system
- Both define a shared vocabulary people from diverse backgrounds can interpret
- Both stand the test of time and persist across multiple time periods

**If you’re starting out, here’s some pointers. This applies to both curriculums and design systems:**
- Do whatever makes the most sense for your use case(s) and for the people using your design system or curriculum. 
  - If it doesn’t make sense, then no one’s going to want to stick with it
- Look up actual design systems. Some examples are linked below:

  - [https://atlassian.design/](https://atlassian.design/)
  - [https://m3.material.io/](https://m3.material.io/)
  - [https://developer.apple.com/design/](https://developer.apple.com/design/)
  - [https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)
  - [https://www.designsystems.com/](https://www.designsystems.com/)
- If you want to make good designs, you have to start designing.
- Learn to not fall in love with your work, because high chances are you will change it later.
  - Sometimes it’s also your boss or consumers making you change it.

### What about EdTech?

Not much to say about it. 

Many of the same rules and concepts you find in design systems you can apply to physical work and educational technology all the same. 

I will say, however, state two points.

Some software you use will look “good” and function properly, while other software will not do either. Over time, the overall quality of software and technology options will increase drastically, but there’s always gaps and deficiencies.

Sometimes you’re forced to use a particular software, or suite of software, to accomplish your goal. At the end of the day, software is a tool to accomplish a task or solve a problem you have and you’ll be better off knowing how to use a tool than not knowing how to use a tool. With tools, however, you won’t get better with them unless you actually use them.

### I don't have much design experience though...

Two things before you panic.
1. You can "design" in PowerPoint, Excel, and Microsoft Word or their equivalents in Google Documents, Sheets, and Slides as well. If you really need advanced design programs, look into tools like Figma, ProtoPie, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch.
2. You're likely focused more on content, the delivery of content, and the management of students rather than design anyways. Learn just enough to get by and supplement your teaching.

Some general rules of thumb you can quickly apply comes from personal experience as well as reading through *Refactoring UI* by Wathan and Schoger.

*Just a headsup, this is still a decently sized list.* 

- Start with simple designs and get them functional first before you add complexity
- It's easier to start with more white space and remove it rather than start with too little white space and add it
- Limit your choices, like number of colors, font sizes, adjustments, etc. early on to avoid analysis paralysis later on
- Emphasize, whether by increasing the size, bolding text, etc. the information a student will look for
- Ideal line height (sometimes called "Line Spacing") is inversely proportional to font size
- Text needs sufficient contrast between itself and the background it's on to be readable
- 5 random colors don't make a good design, but 8-10 shades, both lighter and darker, of 5 random colors can make a good design
- For colorblind people, it's easier to tell by lightness (light/dark) rather than color
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- Many greys you see in the world aren't actually true greys; they grey with another color saturated/mixed in
- For making lighter and darker shades of colors, increase the saturation as well or it looks "washed out"
- HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) is easier to work with compared to RGB and Hex, in my opinion, but many people still work with Hex
- Make paragraphs stay between 45 to 75 characters per line of text when able
- For fonts, stick with a neutral sans-serif, like Roboto, Helvetica Neue, or even Arial if you want
