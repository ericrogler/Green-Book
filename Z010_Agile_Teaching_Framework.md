# “Agile” Teaching Framework

### [Previous Chapter](Z009_Communication_Design_Usability.html)

## **Short Answer**

*Disclaimer: I built this framework in mind for secondary and tertiary education (middle school and above). Elementary school/primary education may need adjustments beyond what is here.*

- **The curriculum you design should mirror what students will do outside the classroom as closely as possible whenever feasible.**
- Many topics can fit into short, fixed-time periods of 1, 2, or 4 weeks/days and include a balance of lectures, activities, projects, and tests.
- Be ready and able to adjust lesson plans as needed, even on a day-by-day basis.
- *Every* subject requires teachers to communicate well through storytelling. If you cannot communicate well and hold students' attention, then you cannot get students to invest in your teachings and learn what they need to know.
- If it works as a summary, use a summary.
- Good lectures are not boring. Bad lectures are boring.
- **"If I am to speak for ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now."** – Former US President Woodrow Wilson

## **Long Answer**

**Here's a weird thought: Education is learning. Teaching is a *form* of learning.**

A student may only need to look up the information to learn about something or to solve a problem. They may not need to utilize the information afterwards. You, as a teacher or non-teaching individual, probably looked up something before on Google, got an answer, and (probably) didn't need to remember that answer later on because it solved your current question/problem.

A teacher, however, goes through multiple steps beyond looking up the information. They have to ensure the information is correct, figure out what parts they need to communicate, figure out the *method* of communication, then *execute* the communication to a broader audience, and adjust–sometimes in the moment–how a concept is presented.

**Paradoxically, teachers are often better learners than, well, students and may learn more new things about the same topic(s) compared to their students–the very people they're trying to educate!**

This gap in learning creates a void to fill with an important question: how does a *student* learn if they're not a teacher and trying to teach others?

### **Where does Agile fit into this?**

For those unfamiliar with Agile, here's the [**Agile Manifesto**](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). It's related to software development, but you can apply it in multiple industries. In practice, though, Agile goes through numerous types of implementation to various levels of success (E.g., "Scrumfall") compared to traditional waterfall practices.

When I was teaching, I settled on a 6/2/2 distribution for my curriculum. In a block of 10 "teaching" days (or two business weeks), this distribution splits into three categories:

- (60%) 6 days lecture
- (20%) 2 days projects and/or activities
- (20%) 2 days tests and/or review

I set this up because I had, in the worst case, 24 units in a single school year to cover. In science, I also had much theoretical information to cover compared to practical experiments to do. I had to be sensible. With this setup, I met standards, and I regained an entire week to explore other future concepts with students in the field of science!

More important notes with the above distribution:

1. Sometimes there are days you lose. It's possible, but difficult, to plan for losses like these, but you'll likely only be able to prepare 1-2 weeks out.
2. This distribution example is for a two-business-week (10-day) coverage of one unit. 1 week (5 days) would be 3/1/1 and 4 weeks (20 days) would be 12/4/4.
3. 1 or 2 week periods work best for me, because you won't go too in-depth when you should summarize instead, and you are less likely to get behind on your teaching schedule.

Some parts in each unit I can summarize and explain fully in a few sentences. Other parts required significantly more depth or required methods where typical text or verbal explanations alone were insufficient.

- Aside: If you want a "fun" way to practice summarizing, read graduate and PhD theses/dissertations and sum them up in layman's terms within two or fewer short sentences. Do that multiple times. It's easier than you think!

**The stages of a Scrum "sprint" in Agile are the following ([further reading](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints)):**

- Planning
- Implementation
- Review
- Retrospective

Scrum is an Agile framework, and the sprint is a part of Scrum. The goal of a sprint is to ship out work on a product, or a completed product, at the end of each sprint. To put "product" another way, your goal is to complete parts of, or the whole, curriculum by your deadline.

I'll go over these four stages and where they apply in a teaching context below. Each unit or "cycle" repeats these four stages continuously from start to end during a school year, semester, or trimester. Though you go through iterations with a sprint, it's not ideal to go across stages in a sprint, such as moving from Implementation to Planning. It's best to go through a whole cycle of Planning, Implementation, Review, and then Retrospective whenever possible, as the Retrospective stage is time dedicated to adjusting your teaching approach, seeing what went wrong or right, and more.

### **Advisory**

Though I do a 6/2/2 setup, other subjects may need more student days dedicated to projects and activities rather than lectures, such as theater, art, athletics, and music. In those scenarios, you could do a 4/4/2, a 2/6/2, or even a 1/8/1 setup if it's primarily project-based rather than theory-based and/or exams aren't the primary way to check for competency.

If your curriculum is more project-based or heavily focuses on activities, dedicate more days to activities and working on projects. If not, dedicate more days to lecture and direct instruction. Always have some time planned for reviewing and tests to ensure material is retained.

### **Planning (Teacher)**

*"If I am to speak for ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now."* – Former US President Woodrow Wilson

The planning phase is what you spend the bulk of your time on and, more often than not, NOT during a class period. The majority is spent during assigned planning periods and outside of school. I also don't include it as part of the "6/2/2" setup because it's not days where students are heavily involved; it's mainly just you as a teacher.

Unlike a typical Scrum sprint, the Planning phase doesn't require the students to be present, but accounts for the capabilities and conditions of students, such as:

- Disabilities & Accommodations, such as IEPs and 504s
- What students can reasonably accomplish
- What skill(s) students have going into the course/unit

Before starting your planning, look for a set of standards or objectives (your product backlog) you need to cover and find the appropriate materials, such as textbooks, that cover or meet those standards and objectives.

*A typical planning phase for me looked like the following for each unit:*

- Review the unit material. You may know it, but it helps to confirm your knowledge.
- Make a list of the names and concepts to cover.
- Verify using the standards to see if I'm meeting goals on each unit.
- Verify with standards what material to test and quiz over by the end of the unit.
- Research additional sources if your current material does not cover all standards.
- Figure out ways to summarize each concept, in case time is cut short due to external factors.
- See what materials I need to bring in, if any, and assess what equipment I have currently.
    - For projects and activities, the Internet is a great place to search for plans, free online labs, and ideas for hands-on learning.
- "Block" out sessions by days and plan for around 5-10 minutes of "waste" or downtime during the period.
    - Downtime could also be time you're not actively teaching and having students work on something in the meantime in class.
- For secondary and primary education, figure out what material students should cover and/or work on when you're absent from school during part(s) of the unit.
- Do a second pass of your unit plan and refine the presentation materials
    - Visuals, diction, summarizing information, explanations, etc.

While this list seems long, it takes only a few times at most to go through before it becomes easy to adapt. Later on in my first year, this took up to 1 hour for each entire unit. You also don't need to write *everything* down on a lesson plan, but this may differ depending on the specific requirements and expectations of your teaching and administrators.

If you're struggling in the planning phase, don't worry. This part takes practice. In my situation, I eventually got each day/class down to lesson plans of 3-4 lines, which leaves me room to adjust and be flexible in a classroom:

- Titles of Section(s)/Activity to cover that day
- 1 sentence on the objectives
- Any other task(s) to cover if able to or if needed

Lastly, as a stern reminder, be aware that no plan you make survives first contact with students. Follow your lesson plans, but be prepared to deviate and adjust when needed and as situations outside of your control arise.

### **Implementation (Teacher & Student)**

Think of "Implementation" as your time to execute your plans made earlier in a teaching environment, whether in person or through distance learning. The majority of days for each unit are here. (6 days and 2 days, or 8 days total, from my original "6/2/2" setup).

There are two primary methods: lectures and projects/activities. There's also a part called "daily scrum" where you, the teacher, can quickly reassess your progress and make minor to moderate adjustments if needed.

***Lectures***

Lectures are the first "6" of my setup. Again, you can decrease lecture days for more hands-on classes.

These are sessions used to deliver–mainly verbally–a significant amount of information all at once to a student, or group of students, and allow them to ask questions.

**With lectures, you need to focus on three areas *alongside* the material you're teaching: passion, knowledge, and entertainment.**

**Passion is how much you care about what you're teaching.** If you can show you care–preferably in a genuine manner, but even an attempt is fine–then you can get students to care.

**Knowledge is how much you know about the subject(s) you're teaching.** It's entirely possible to teach by reading out the material, straight from a textbook. Still, your students may question your teaching ability if you also cannot successfully answer their questions, which leads to disengagement and less effective teaching.

**Entertainment is the ability to *hold* attention.** You don't need to dance like a monkey in front of students, but you also shouldn't be bland and monotone. If you're not able to hold a student's attention, they'll lose that attention. They may create problems for you *and* other students, negatively bringing down the classroom. Steve Jobs' speech with the iPhone reveal, TED Talks, TikTok, social media applications, and YouTube shorts are excellent examples of how you can hold the attention of people across all ages.

The combination of these three areas, with your teaching material, culminates in storytelling; the ability to tell engaging stories (or "sell" something that students "buy" into with their attention and willingness to learn).

Though some may criticize "sage on the stage" style lectures, with valid points, they are highly effective when done well. You are not limited to only words; you can use images, drawings, occasionally get students to follow along with something while lecturing, ask them questions about what you're teaching, and more. You can play off of student tangents relevant to your topic and have the tangent used as a question on a test, to keep students' attention by inserting the unexpected question here and there.

**Lecturing works great if the lecture is well structured. If not, then it does not work well.** It is a powerful tool for learning, but it requires preparation and dedication on the teacher's part.

***Activities / Projects***

Activities and projects are the first "2" of my setup. **I recommend doing no fewer than 1 to 2 activities or projects per unit, unless your material is nearly all theoretical,** as you may lose student engagement from over-repetition.

Activities and projects are ways to break the monotony of a classroom and force students to solve problems or perform work they otherwise cannot do easily in a lecture. These may be the toughest type to implement, because many things can go very wrong, very quickly.

If you haven't reviewed your safety measures for activities, plan to review them as soon as possible to ensure compliance. You can do multiple days if there are many procedures to cover. You also need to run a test to see if students truly know the safety measures, and space it between activity days, lecture days, and review days. How much you invest in safety talks depends on the subject(s) you're teaching. A class on math won't require as many safety talks as a class on wilderness survival, for example.

For activities and projects, do not be afraid to use the Internet for inspiration and gather ideas. Compared to finding textual information on how things work, it's much harder to find practical applications for that information.

**When I search for activities, I consider some of the following:**

- Does this activity meet the standards I have to follow?
- Do I–or can I–get the equipment for this without significant difficulty and/or cost?
- Is this safe for students to do or not?
- Can I fit this into in-class time, or does it require time outside of a classroom?
- Do I need to make additional materials or edits to the activity to accommodate students?
- How will I manage the activity inside the classroom?
- Do I need to account for disabilities or accommodations with the activity?

While many activities can be done on computers as of 2025, such as planetary orbit simulations, some activities *have* to be done in a physical environment and often are better done in a physical environment where students can touch, feel, and/or see what is happening.

Lastly, with activities, you're expected to manage students more than in lectures. Managing isn't necessarily a bad thing, but an observed fact of doing activities; you're giving students more freedom and not confining them (mostly) to chairs or in a single spot, so your role of keeping them on task intensifies greatly.

### **"Daily Scrum" (Teacher)** 

Think of the daily Scrum as your reassessment of your classroom and what you got done during the day. Do NOT go back to the planning stage yet.

After each day/class session, you can see which topic(s) were covered, how well they were covered, and then spend a bit of time making minor to moderate adjustments if needed. Do NOT make major adjustments after initial planning outside of emergencies; it is a time sink and an enormous headache.

### **Review (Teacher & Student)**

In the review stage, we get to the last "2" in my "6/2/2" setup. Review is when you're presenting the material you've implemented in the previous stage, whether through lectures, activities, or a combination of the two.

In teaching, review sorts out deficiencies in learning, identifying where students struggle with the material, and demonstrating that students have "done" the learning they need.

You can prove learning through tests, quizzes, review sessions, questionnaires, exit tickets, and more. For each of these sessions, you must explicitly define the test-taking conditions, such as what is allowed, what is not allowed, how much you can help a student with questions, how to take the test, the time allotted, and what other resources they may bring into the test.

There are two ways I would separate the review days, as my example accounts for 2 days' worth of time out of 10 days total.

1. 1 day of testing, 1 day of dedicated review
2. 1 day of testing, 1 day of review spread out among lecture days.

In both cases, dedicated testing is non-negotiable as you need an assessment with stakes to evaluate proper learning. The difference is how you review and check the "progress" of learning.

In the first method, this assumes you'll set aside an entire day to review every concept and standard for the unit. Many students may appreciate this as it gives them a "breather" and time to review and reinforce areas they may have forgotten or are lacking in. Other students, however, may not want or desire this, as they'd prefer not to spend the extra time and complete the unit more quickly. A dedicated review day also allows final adjustments to determine what to review and test based on current student progress.

In the second method, you'll still do a review, but typically at the end of each lecture day. As an example, instead of 50 minutes of dedicated review on one day, you take up the 5-10 minutes you initially allocated for downtime and "waste" and do shorter reviews on the concepts covered explicitly on that day. End-of-class reviews let you go through the unit faster, but require more pre-planning on the teacher's part to compensate for the lost in-class time. Additionally, you'll have to specifically remind students when a test is, as they may expect a review before the test rather than going straight into learning with a test the day after.

**In general, I recommend you go with the first method: 1 day of testing with 1 day of dedicated review.** The second method is more complex to implement and more challenging for students. Still, it does save you time, gives you the chance to cover more material within the year, semester, or trimester, and provides more buffer days in case of unexpected events.

### **Retrospective (Teacher)**

This part is outside of the "6/2/2" setup as it's done primarily through planning periods and not days where students are heavily involved. Additionally, the time spent here varies from minutes to hours, but you should not spend more than 2 to 3 hours here.

The retrospective is a time for you, as a teacher, to figure out ways to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of your teaching plans, style, presentation, and more.  You figure out what went well, what did not go well, what problems arose, and any solutions you made to solve problems you faced.

If you find significant improvements, assess the feasibility of implementation and then implement them. You may also discover new material that you didn't cover in this unit. You may need or want to cover it in the next unit.

### **“The One-a-week” Structure**

Sometimes you won't have multiple days per week for teaching and instead delegate a single day per week, across various weeks, for all of your class periods.

The 6/2/2 distribution still applies in this case, but it's a little different. Rather than days, you think in terms of hours. The same rules also apply if you need to change the distribution amongst lecturing, activities/projects, and review/tests.

For example, let's say you're in an adult learning session and you attend a class once a week. Each class period is 2 hours long. There are two ways to split this: intraday or interday.

***Intraday***

In an intraday setup, you're doing a varied distribution all within a 2-hour-long class period, and repeating this each day for every week. There are times when it's OK–and sometimes expected–to break this rule, such as when you need an entire day for a test or mostly an activity day.

Going back to our 2-hour example, your typical classroom day may look like this:

- (60%) ~72 minutes lecture
- (20%) ~24 minutes projects/activities
- (20%) ~24 minutes tests/review
- Total: 120 minutes or 2 hours

You'll still follow the same advice I mentioned for each category. You may replace part of your lecture test/review time with a 5-10 minute break to allow recuperation, downtime, or an excuse to grab a snack or a drink midway in class. You can subdivide that total time into further blocks, but no more than four blocks for each "topic" in this period. For example, one or two topics are lecture-heavy, but another topic is project activity-heavy, on the same day. You can distribute more "lectures" towards some topics and more "activity" towards other topics, all in the same day.

Keep in mind this setup requires strict planning on your part and equally strict time management, as it's easy to lose track of time and sacrifice time in one topic because you spent too long in another.

***Interday***

Interday is similar to a typical classroom setup. Still, instead of multiple days in one week, it is various days across many weeks.

This method is more straightforward compared to intraday because you can dedicate entire days to one type of learning, if applicable, to the subject at hand. The downside, though, is that you have to plan out what to say throughout that entire period actively, or you risk losing valuable teaching time due to poor planning.

Using the same 2-hour example, we can do another distribution like this:

- 3 days (3 weeks) of lecture
- 1 day (1 week) of project/activity
- 1 day (1 week) of review/test

You could combine lectures and projects/activities into 4 days rather than a 3-day split, putting lectures and activities on the same day. It depends on the needs of the class and if it's the best way to learn about what you're teaching.

***What if I have one day (or a weekend) for the entire curriculum instead of one day a week?***

Pretending you're combining multiple weeks into a day and scaling down the values and time estimates. You'll adjust some parts depending on the material and what you need to cover, but it is doable.

To give an example, let's say we normally need 8 weeks to teach a topic, but only have one workday (8 hours total). You could do something like this:
- 4 weeks of lecture --> 4 hours of lecture
- 2 weeks of project/activity --> 2 hours of projects/activities
- 2 weeks of review/test --> 2 hours split between separate review(s) and a test

Sprinkle in short breaks throughout the parts as needed or when the session requires it.

**Do not underestimate how long it takes to condense information. It can take a short or extensive amount of time to convert a long-term curriculum into a shorter one.

***Cost Overage vs Cost Underage (Teaching too much vs too little in X time)***

You may have seen these terms before in an engineering, supply chain, or production context, where underage costs are costs when you don't have enough inventory to meet demand, and overage costs are costs when you have too much inventory beyond demand. If you're unfamiliar with these terms and want to learn more, look for "Newsvendor Model" on Google or another search engine.

In teaching, overage and underage costs are part of your monetary costs and budgeting, but also a way to define if you're teaching the optimal amount of content in a given timeframe. This problem typically deals with supply quantities rather than timeframes, so my example may deviate from standard models.

You have a curriculum with a deadline of 26 weeks. You *have* to teach for the full 26 weeks, no more or no less, even if you get done with your material early. You cannot take longer than 26 weeks. Overage cost is what you incur when you cannot finish your curriculum in 26 weeks (due to excessive material or unplanned absences). In contrast, underage cost is what you incur when you finish the curriculum too early.

Your underage costs–If you get done early–could be additional material, supplies, and work to supplement any extra free time you have left. Your overage costs–if you take too long or are delayed too often past 26 weeks–are cutting content or omitting material to fit within the timeframe, which means you may not meet the appropriate standards you're supposed to cover.

There's also a chance you could go over or under your deadline of 26 weeks; you're not certain, as things can always affect your timelines from now until then. Your overage cost and underage cost weigh against those chances to determine whether or not you want to spend much time or a little time on specific subjects within your curriculum to meet a deadline, as well as when to "cut" out material to meet your deadline and standards.

The newsvendor model is one way to illustrate how having too little or too much material is costly and detrimental to all parties involved, beyond the production context. The example provided is highly simplified, and in real-world scenarios, there are significantly more costs and factors involved.
