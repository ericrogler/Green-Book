# “Agile” Teaching Framework

## **Short Answer**

*Disclaimer: I built this framework in mind for secondary and tertiary education (middle school and above). Elementary school/primary education may need adjustments beyond what is written here.*

- **The curriculum you design should mirror what students will do outside the classroom as closely as possible whenever feasible.**
- Many topics you’re teaching can be blocked into short, fixed-time periods of 1, 2, or 4 weeks/days and include a balance of lectures, activities, projects, and tests.
- Be ready and able to adjust lesson plans as needed, even on a day-by-day basis.
- *Every* subject requires teachers to communicate well through storytelling. If you cannot communicate well and hold students’ attention, then you cannot get students to invest into your teachings and learn what they need to learn.
- If something can be explained well in a short summary, use a short summary.
- Good lectures are not boring. Bad lectures are boring.

## **Long Answer**

**Here’s a weird thought: Education is best done through learning. Teaching is a *form* of learning.**

A student may only need to look up the information to learn about something or to solve a problem and then they may not need to utilize the information afterwards. You, as a teacher or non-teaching individual, probably looked up something before on Google, got an answer, and (probably) didn’t need to remember that answer later on because it solved your current question/problem.

A teacher, however, goes through multiple steps beyond looking up the information. They have to ensure the information is correct, figure out what parts they need to communicate, figure out the *method* of communication, then *execute* the communication to a wider audience, and adjust–sometimes in the moment–how a concept is communicated if it isn’t understood the first time around.

**Paradoxically, teachers are often better learners than, well, students and may learn more new things about the same topic(s) compared to their students–the very people they’re trying to educate!**

This creates a void to fill with an important question: how does a *student* learn if they’re not a teacher and trying to teach others?

### **Where does Agile fit into this?**

For those unfamiliar with Agile, here’s the [**Agile Manifesto**](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). It’s related to software development, but you can apply it in multiple industries. In practice though, Agile goes through multiple types of implementation to various levels of success (E.g. “Scrumfall”) compared to traditional waterfall practices.

When I was teaching, I settled on a 6/2/2 distribution for my curriculum. In a block of 10 “teaching” days (or 2 business weeks), this distribution is split into three categories:

- (60%) 6 days lecture
- (20%) 2 days projects and/or activities
- (20%) 2 days tests and/or review

Why I did this setup is because I had, in the worst case, *24 units in a single school year to cover*. In science, I also had a lot of theoretical information to cover compared to practical experiments to do. I had to be practical. With this setup, each concept and standard was met and I got back an entire week of time to explore other future concepts with students in the field of science!

More important notes with the above distribution:

1. Sometimes there are days you lose. It’s possible, but difficult, to plan for losses like these, but you’ll likely only be able to plan 1-2 weeks out.
2. This distribution example is for a 2 business week (10 day) coverage of one unit. 1 week (5 days) would be 3/1/1 and 4 weeks (20 days) would be 12/4/4.
3. 1 or 2 week periods work best for me, because you aren’t tempted to go too in-depth when you should summarize instead and you are less likely to get behind on your teaching schedule.

Some parts in each unit I can summarize and explain fully in a few sentences. Other parts required significantly more depth or required methods where typical text or verbal explanations alone were insufficient.

- Aside: If you want a “fun” way to practice summarizing, read graduate and PhD theses/dissertations and sum them up in layman terms within 2 or fewer short sentences. Do that multiple times. It’s easier than you think!

**The stages of a Scrum “sprint” in Agile are the following ([further reading](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints)):**

- Planning
- Implementation
- Review
- Retrospective

Scrum is an Agile framework and the sprint is a part of Scrum. The goal of a sprint is to ship out work on a product, or a completed product, at the end of each sprint. To put “product” another way, your goal is completing parts of, or the whole, curriculum in your deadline.

I’ll go over these four stages and where they apply in a teaching context below. Each unit or “cycle” repeats these four stages continuously from start to end during a school year, semester, or trimester. Though you go through iterations with a sprint, it’s not ideal to go across stages in a sprint, such as Implementation back into Planning. You’re better going through a full stage of Planning, Implementation, Review, then Retrospective whenever possible, as the Retrospective stage is time dedicated to adjusting your teaching approach, seeing what went wrong or right, and more.

### **Advisory**

Though I do a 6/2/2 setup, other subjects may need more student days dedicated to projects and activities rather than lectures, such as theater, art, athletics, and music. In those scenarios, you could do a 4/4/2, a 2/6/2, or even a 1/8/1 setup if it’s primarily project-based rather than theory-based and/or exams aren’t the primary way to check for competency.

If your curriculum is more project-based, or heavily focuses on activities, dedicate more days to activities and working on projects. If not, dedicate more days to lecture and direct instruction. Always have some time planned for reviewing and tests to ensure material is properly learned.

### **Planning (Teacher)**

*“If I am to speak for ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now.”* – Former US President Woodrow Wilson

The planning phase is what you spend the bulk of your time on and, more often than not, NOT during a class period. The majority is spent during assigned planning periods and outside of school. I also don’t include it as part of the “6/2/2” setup because it's not days where students are heavily involved; it’s mainly just you as a teacher.

Unlike a typical Scrum sprint, the Planning phase doesn’t require the students present, but still takes into account the capabilities and conditions of students, such as:

- Disabilities & Accommodations, such as IEPs and 504s
- What students can reasonably accomplish
- What skill(s) students have going into the course/unit

Before starting your planning, look for a set of standards or objectives (your product backlog) you need to cover and find the appropriate materials, such as textbooks, covering or meeting those standards and objectives.

*A typical planning phase for me looked like the following for each unit:*

- Review the unit material. You may know it, but it helps to guarantee you know.
- Make a list of the names and concepts to cover.
- Verify using the standards to see if I’m meeting goals on each unit.
- Verify with standards what material to test and quiz over by the end of the unit.
- Research additional sources if your current material does not cover all standards.
- Figure out ways to summarize each concept, in case time is cut short due to external factors.
- See what materials I need to bring in, if any, and assess what equipment I have currently.
    - For projects and activities, the Internet is a great place to search for plans, free online labs, and ideas for hands-on learning.
- “Block” out sessions by days and plan for around 5-10 minutes of “waste” or down time during the period.
    - Downtime could also be time you’re not actively teaching and having students work on something in the meantime in class.
- For secondary and primary education, figure out what material students should cover and/or work on when you’re absent for school during part(s) of the unit.
- Do a second pass of your unit plan and do refinement of presentation materials
    - Visuals, diction, summarizing information, explanations, etc.

While this list seems long, it takes only a few times at most to go through before it becomes easy to adapt. Later on in my first year, this took about up to 1 hour for each entire unit. You also don’t need to write *everything* down on a lesson plan, but this may differ depending on where your teaching and requirements administrators placed upon you.

If you’re struggling in the planning phase, don’t worry. This part takes practice. In my situation I eventually got each day/class down to lesson plans of 3-4 lines, which leaves me room to adjust and be flexible in a classroom:

- Titles of Section(s)/Activity to cover that day
- 1 sentence on the objectives
- Any other task(s) to cover if able to or if needed

Lastly, as a stern reminder, be aware no plan you make survives first contact with students. Follow your lesson plans, but be prepared to deviate and adjust when needed and as situations outside of your control arise.

### **Implementation (Teacher & Student)**

Think of “Implementation” as your time to execute your plans made earlier in a teaching environment, whether physically or by distance learning. The majority of days for each unit are spent here. (6 days and 2 days, or 8 days total, from my original “6/2/2” setup).

There’s two primary methods of implementation: lectures and projects/activities. There’s also a part called “daily scrum” where you, the teacher, can quickly reassess your progress and make minor to moderate adjustments if needed.

***Lectures***

This is the first “6” of my setup. Again, you can decrease lecture days for more hands-on classes.

These are sessions used to deliver–mainly verbally–a significant amount of information all at once to a student, or group or students, and allowing them to ask questions.

**With lectures, you need to focus on three areas *alongside* the material you’re teaching: passion, knowledge, and entertainment.**

**Passion is how much you care about what you’re teaching.** If you can show you care–preferably in a genuine manner, but even an attempt is fine–then you can get students to also care.

**Knowledge is how much you know about the subject(s) you’re teaching.** It’s entirely possible to teach by reading out the material, straight from a textbook, but your students may question your teaching ability if you also cannot successfully answer their questions, which leads to disengagement and less effective teaching.

**Entertainment is the ability to *hold* attention.** You don’t need to dance like a monkey in front of students, but you also shouldn’t be bland and monotone. If you’re not able to hold a student’s attention, they’ll lose that attention and may create problems for you *and* other students, negatively bringing down the classroom. Steve Jobs’ speech with the iPhone reveal, TED Talks, TikTok, social media applications, and YouTube shorts are excellent examples of how you can hold the attention of people across all ages.

The combination of these three areas, with the material you’re teaching, culminates into storytelling; the ability to tell interesting stories (or “sell” something that students “buy” into with their attention and willingness to learn).

Though some may criticize “sage on the stage” style lectures, with valid points, they are extremely effective when done well. You are not limited to only words; you can use images, drawings, occasionally get students to follow along with something while lecturing, ask them questions about what you’re teaching, and more. If you’re able to, you can even play off of student tangents relevant to your topic and have the tangent used as a question on a test, just to keep student’s attention by inserting the unexpected question here and there.

**Lecturing works great if the lecture is well structured. If not, then it does not work well.** It is a powerful tool for learning, but requires preparation and dedication on the teacher’s part.

***Activities / Projects***

This is the first “2” of my setup. **I’d advise against doing fewer than 1 to 2 activities or projects per unit, unless your material is nearly all theoretical** or confined strictly to lecture-based teaching, as you may lose student engagement from over-repetition.

Activities and projects are ways to break the monotony of a classroom and force students to solve problems or perform work they otherwise cannot do easily in a lecture. This may be the toughest type to implement, because a lot of things can go very wrong, very quickly.

If you haven’t gone over any safety measures for activities, plan 1 day out as soon as possible to go over all of your safety measures so you can check that box. You can do multiple days if it’s many procedures to cover, as well as need to run a test on if students truly know the safety measures, and space it between activity days, lecture days, and review days. How much you invest in safety talks depends on your subject(s) you’re teaching. A class on math won’t require as much safety talks as a class on wilderness survival, for an example.

For activities and projects, do not be afraid to use the Internet for inspiration and gather ideas. Compared to finding textual information on how things work, it’s much harder to find physical and workable implementations to apply that information.

**When I search for activities, I consider some of the following:**

- Does this activity meet the standards I have to follow?
- Do I–or can I–get the equipment for this without significant difficulty and/or cost?
- Is this safe for students to do or not?
- Can I fit this into in-class time, or does it require time outside of a classroom?
- Do I need to make additional materials or edits to the activity to accommodate students?
- How will I manage the activity inside of the classroom?
- Do I need to account for disabilities or accommodations with the activity?

While many activities can be done on computers as of 2025, such as planetary orbit simulations, some activities *have* to be done in a physical environment and often are better done in a physical environment where students can touch, feel, and/or see what is happening.

Lastly, with activities, you’re expected to manage students more compared to lectures. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but an observed fact of doing activities; you’re giving students more freedom and not confining them (mostly) to chairs or in a single spot, so your role of keeping them on task intensifies greatly.

### **“Daily Scrum” (Teacher)** 

Think of the daily scrum as your reassessment of your classroom and what you got done during the day. This is NOT going back to the planning stage.

After each day/class session, you can see which topic(s) were covered, how well they were covered, and then spend a bit of time making minor to moderate adjustments. Do NOT make major adjustments after initial planning outside of emergencies; it is a time sink and a large headache.

### **Review (Teacher & Student)**

In the review stage, we get to the last “2” in my “6/2/2” setup. Review is when you’re presenting the material you’ve implemented in the previous stage, whether through lectures, activities, or a combination of the two.

In teaching, review sorts out deficiencies in learning, seeing where students had difficulties in the material they’re learning, and demonstrates students have “done” the learning they need.

This may be done through tests, quizzes, review sessions, questionnaires, exit tickets, and more. For each of these sessions, you must explicitly define the test-taking conditions, such as what is allowed, what is not allowed, how much you can help a student with questions, how to take the test, time allotted, and what other resources they may bring into the test.

There are two ways I would separate the review days, as my example accounts for 2 days worth of time out of 10 days total.

1. 1 day of testing, 1 day of dedicated review
2. 1 day of testing, 1 day of review spread out among lecture days.

In both cases, dedicated testing is non-negotiable as you need an assessment with stakes to evaluate proper learning. The difference is how you review and check “progress” of learning.

In the first method, this assumes you’ll set aside an entire day as review to go over every concept and standard for the unit. Many students may appreciate this as it gives them a “breather” and a whole day to find areas to refocus learning they may have forgotten throughout the unit. Other students, however, may not want or desire this as they’d prefer not to spend the excess time and get through the unit faster. A dedicated review day also allows final adjustments to decide what to review and what to test over based on current student progress.

In the second method, you’ll still do review but typically at the end of each lecture day. As an example, instead of 50 minutes of dedicated review on one day, you take up the 5-10 minutes you originally allocated for down-time and “waste” and do shorter reviews on the concepts covered explicitly on that day. This lets you go through the unit faster, but risks more forgetting material on the students' part and requires more pre-planning on the teacher's part to make up for the loss of in-class time. Additionally, you’ll have to specifically remind students when a test is, as they may expect a review before the test rather than going straight into learning with a test the day right after.

**In general, I recommend you go with the first method: 1 day of testing with 1 day of dedicated review.** The second method is harder to implement and higher difficulty for students, but it does save you time, give you the chance to cover more material within the year, semester, or trimester, and provide more buffer days in case of unexpected events.

### **Retrospective (Teacher)**

This part is outside of the “6/2/2” setup as it's done primarily through planning periods and not days where students are heavily involved. Additionally, the time spent here heavily varies from minutes to hours, but you should not spend more than 2 to 3 hours here.

The retrospective is time for you, as a teacher, to figure out ways to improve effectiveness and efficiency of your teaching plans, style, presentation, and more.  You figure out what went well, what did not go well, what problems were encountered, and any solutions you made to solve problems you faced.

If you find significant improvements, see if they can be implemented and then implement them. You may also discover new material that you didn’t cover in this unit you may need or want to cover in the next unit.

### **“The One-a-week” Structure**

Sometimes you won’t have multiple days per week for teaching and instead delegate a single day out of a week, across multiple weeks, for all of your class periods.

The 6/2/2 distribution still applies in this case, but it’s a little different. Rather than days, you think in terms of hours. The same rules also apply if you need to change how much focus is distributed amongst lecturing, activities/projects, and review/tests.

For example, let’s say you’re in an adult learning session and you attend a class once a week. Each class period is 2 hours long. There’s two ways to split this: intraday or interday.

***Intraday***

In an intraday setup, you’re doing a varied distribution all within a 2 hour long class period, and repeating this each day for every week.There are times where it’s OK–and sometimes expected–to break this rule, such as when you need an entire day for a test or mostly an activity day.

Going back to our 2 hour example, your typical classroom day may look like this:

- (60%) ~72 minutes lecture
- (20%) ~24 minutes projects/activities
- (20%) ~24 minutes tests/review
- Total: 120 minutes or 2 hours

You’ll still follow the same advice I mentioned for each category, but you may replace part of your lecture test/review time with a 5-10 minute midway to allow recuperation, downtime, or an excuse to grab a snack or a drink midway in class. You can subdivide that total time down into further blocks, but no more than 4 blocks for each “topic” in this time period. For example, maybe 1 or 2 topics are lecture heavy, but another topic is project activity heavy, in the same classroom day. You can distribute more “lectures” towards some topics and more “activity” towards other topics, all in the same day.

Keep in mind this setup requires strict planning on your part and equally strict time management, as it’s easy to lose track of time and sacrifice time in one topic because you spent too long in another.

***Interday***

Interday is similar to a typical classroom setup, but instead of multiple days in one week, it is multiple days across many weeks.

This method is easier compared to intraday because you can dedicate entire days to one type of learning, if applicable, to the subject at hand. The downside, though, is you have to actively plan out what to say throughout that entire period or you risk losing valuable teaching time due to poor planning.

Using the same 2 hour example, we can do another distribution like this:

- 3 days (3 weeks) of lecture
- 1 day (1 week) of project/activity
- 1 day (1 week) of review/test

You could combine lecture and projects/activities into 4 days rather than a 3 one split if desired, putting lecture and activity inside of the same day. It depends on the needs of the class and if it’s the best way to learn about what you’re teaching.

***What if I have 1 day (or a weekend) for the entire curriculum instead of 1-a-week?***

Pretending you're combining multiple weeks together into a day and scale down the values and time estimates. You'll adjust some parts depending on the material and what you need to cover, but it is doable.

To give an example, let's say we normally need 8 weeks to teach a topic, but only have one work day (8 hours total). You could do something like this:
- 4 weeks of lecture --> 4 hours of lecture
- 2 weeks of project/activity --> 2 hours of projects/activities
- 2 weeks of review/test --> 2 hours split between separate review(s) and a test

Sprinkle in short breaks throughout the parts as needed or when the session requires it.

**Do not underestimate how long it takes to condense information.** It can take a short amount of time, or an extensive amount of time, to convert a long timeframe curriculum into a shortened curriculum.

**Cost Overage vs Cost Underage (Teaching too much vs too little in X time)**

You may have seen these terms before in an engineering, supply chain, or production context, where underage costs are costs when you don’t have enough inventory to meet demand and overage costs are costs when you have too much inventory beyond demand. If you have not heard these terms before and want to learn about more, look for “Newsvendor Model” on Google or another search engine. (**[Further reading from MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-772j-d-lab-supply-chains-fall-2014/6952be57b43aa185119c6f114908bcc5_MIT15_772JF14_Newsboy.pdf) (warning: higher-level math!)**)

In teaching, overage and underage costs are part of your monetary costs and budgeting, but also a way to define if you’re teaching the optimal amount of content in a given timeframe. This problem normally deals with supply quantities rather than timeframes, so my example may deviate from standard models.

You have a curriculum with a deadline of 26 weeks worth of time. You *have* to teach for the full 26 weeks, no more or no less, even if you get done with your material early. You cannot take longer than 26 weeks. Overage cost is what you incur when you cannot finish your curriculum in 26 weeks (having too much material to try and cover or too many days taken off which were not planned for), whereas underage cost is what you incur when you finish the curriculum too early.

Your underage costs–If you get done early–could be additional material, supplies, and work to supplement any additional free time you have left. Your overage costs–if you take too long or are delayed too often past 26 weeks–is cutting content or omitting material to fit within the timeframe, which means you may not meet the appropriate standards you’re supposed to cover.

There’s also a *chance* you could go over or under your deadline of 26 weeks; you’re not certain as things can always affect your timelines from now until then. Your overage cost and underage cost is weighted against those chances to determine whether or not you want to spend a lot of time or a little time on certain subjects within your curriculum to meet a deadline, as well as when to “cut” out material to meet your deadline and standards.

The newsvendor model is one way to illustrate how having too little or too much material is costly and detrimental to all parties involved, even outside of a production context. The example provided is extremely simplified and in real-world scenarios there are significantly more costs and factors involved.
