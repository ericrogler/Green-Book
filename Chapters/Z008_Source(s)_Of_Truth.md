# Source(s) of Truth

## **Short Answer**

**“Absence of Evidence is not Evidence of Absence” – Carl Sagan, Astronomer**

Even if you are the innovator and/or pioneer of the subject/field you are teaching, you won’t know *everything* and you should expect to use external sources of information to reinforce and supplement your teaching. If you happen to find someone who knows and can do everything and anything, please tell me so I can add them to my network and get an amazing professional reference for my future career path.

## **Long Answer**

There’s two sources of truth you have to work with: the knowledge you’ve already acquired vs knowledge you need to seek out and use in teaching.

For both ways, I personally like this quotation from the former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld he delivered back on February 12, 2002.

> *“Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.”*
> 

There’s three explicit categories stated here: known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns. A fourth category was observed and added by Steve Rayner in 2012 called “uncomfortable knowledge,” which I’ll refer to as unknown knowns.

**In reference to teaching, you get the following:**

| **Types** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Known Known** | The domain knowledge, skills, and expertise you learned through rigorous effort and/or time. |
| **Known Unknown** | Areas of knowledge you have familiarity with, such as summaries and general information, but lack the specifics and details on. |
| **Unknown Known** |Judgments, biases and preconceived notions towards new and old information, policies, and behaviors you do without always being aware of them. |
| **Unknown Unknown** | Information that you are neither aware of, understand, nor can properly predict and expect. |
---

### Exploring Outside Your Field
Though Rumsfeld mentions unknown unknowns as difficult, I’d also categorize unknown knowns as equally difficult. Beliefs, suppositions, and practices we seem to not know of may form the values we know of, follow, and practice.

For your curriculum and meeting standards, you'll be dealing with mainly known knowns and known unknowns. You’re able to teach because you know what you’re teaching and for parts you’re uncertain about on the subjects you’re covering (known unknowns), you’re able to find and research resources elsewhere, make sense of them, and pull them into the teaching environment. In the process of researching, you’ll eventually come upon information that you may or may use in teaching, but didn’t know about before, existed, or originally thought relevant to your subject(s) (unknown unknowns). Funny how intelligence work is useful in teaching too.

Keep in mind you’re not exclusively limited to the area you’re teaching. I’d actively encourage you to look beyond your field for other information you may find useful.

Say for example you’re teaching engineering. You don’t only need to bring in engineering resources; you can bring in case studies, articles, and examples from multiple fields like management, finance, aerospace, communication, and more. From there, you can use that to gain a new perspective, link it into the material you’re teaching to reinforce ideas and show practical use, or use that newfound knowledge to reinforce *how* you teach.

To show what I mean, here is a small list of books I personally used for designing a curriculum. 

- *Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning* by Peter Brown, Henry Roediger III, and Mark McDaniel
- *Uncommon Sense Teaching: Practical Insights in Brain Science to Help Students Learn* by Barbara Oakley, Beth Rogowsky, and Terrence Sejnowski
- *Resonate* by Nancy Duarte
- *Just Enough Research* by Erika Hall
- *Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days* by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, and Braden Kowitz
- *Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (3rd Edition) (Voices That Matter)* by Steve Krug
- *Articulating Design Decisions: Communicate with Stakeholders, Keep Your Sanity, and Deliver the Best User Experience* by Tom Greever
- *Smart Brevity: The Power of Saying More with Less* by Jim VandeHei, Mike Allen, and Roy Schwartz

Despite my teaching focus on science and engineering, I found useful information in other sources like communication and design books. This is a small sample, but shows an example where looking into information outside of your field may help you in the long run.

### Regarding Wikipedia

Lastly, I’m going to end with a note on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is extremely good as a one stop source for what you’re trying to look up and it’s heavily moderated; a lot of misinformation gets corrected quickly and, in intentional misinformation, a ban of the offender. For the average layman and in general, it’s a good resource.

**Now for my criticisms of Wikipedia:** 
- Wikipedia is terrible for research and is not appropriate for essay or research citations, as it doesn’t follow a scientific procedure to get information (there’s some irony here considering how I’m writing this guide, but I digress). 
- Any person can create an account and submit edits to Wikipedia articles, which brings into question the credentials and background of the people writing the information in the first place. 
- **A Wikipedia article does not hold the same weight as a peer-reviewed research article, *even if they have the exact same information*, due to each source’s credibility.** 
- Subject to bias of the editors on any viewpoints they may add or opinions they bring in, even if the information is factually correct. 

You also won’t figure out the reputations of sources from Wikipedia alone, as Wikipedia is a compilation of information drawn in from multiple sources. It also stuns the ability to do research, as students may think Wikipedia is “good enough” and not bother to research beyond that. Additionally, the information you get from Wikipedia is extremely easy to change, whereas books, peer-review articles, and the like are *not* easily changed.

Despite Wikipedia’s benefits and drawbacks, it’s inevitable a student may use it, if not at least look at it. To counter this, consider implementing the following for work where students do research:

- If you look at Wikipedia, go to the bottom of the page/article and look for headers like “References” and “External Links.” Use the information from *those* sources as research and citations.
- Wikipedia is OK as a starting point, but no further.
- Ensure you’re able to evaluate sources properly through critical thinking. The following links are two ways of evaluating sources:
