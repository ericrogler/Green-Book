# Metrics Of Success

## **Short Answer**

Depends on your goals, but metrics should be measures designed to be consistent and objective. Test scores are one common–and visible–metric to base performance on.

**To quote Goodhart’s Law: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”**

## **Long Answer**

Though you’re not typically in the business or finance sector, unless you’re teaching about that or it’s a job you have, there’s some terms you need to know and there's a way to see if a change in your curriculum provides a boost or not. Metrics of success are measures verifying if strategies or implementations are working properly. How a measure is interpreted can be subjective or objective and depends on the needs of the people utilizing the metric.

You want to choose the right metrics to gauge success. A single metric is not ideal and you want multiple metrics, so you are not at much risk of making a metric a target and can show improvement in multiple ways. What those metrics are depend on the goals of the teacher and organization using them. Your goals as a teacher may align with maximizing outcomes, like scores and pass rates, qualitative aspects, like engagement and relationships, or positive signs of growth, like outlooks, views, and student character. It could be a combination of any of these as well, or some days your metric of success is getting through to the next day.

There are two types of data associated with metrics: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data is a specific and objective measure capturing numbers, quantities, and ranges. Qualitative data is based on subject and explanatory measures of qualities, traits, and characteristics. In short, quantitative deals with numbers and qualitative deals with words/images. 

It is possible to convert qualitative data into quantitative data through methods like sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML). While the inverse is possible, quantitative into qualitative, it is rarely done outside of categorizing, bucketing, and labeling. Quantitative data can also be used for models and optimized through techniques and heuristics like simulated annealing.

The details of these methods and all of these methods in general are beyond the scope of this writing, but bringing awareness to it is helpful should you need to delve into deeper analysis in the future.

Qualitative data may be coupled alongside quantitative data, or separate from quantitative data, depending on your needs. Some examples of quantitative metrics you may see in education are the following:

- GPA / Grades (Academic Performance)
- Support Service Utilization
- Time to Completion
- Graduation Rate
- Retention Rate (Churn)
- Post-Graduate Employment Rate
- Test Scores (State, ACT, SAT, IB, AP, etc.)
- Attendance / Participation

You’ll want to be careful when measuring data. You are subject to multiple biases based on what you sample and the demographics of the sample (i.e. students). Your interpretation of data and how students affect data is also at risk of data bias as well. Several examples of bias include, but most certainly are not limited to, the following:

- Confirmation bias
- Observer bias
- Selection bias
- Recall bias
- Reporting bias
- Sampling bias
- Survivorship bias
- Measurement bias
- Social bias

**As a human being, you will have a bias present in some way, form, or fashion; unconscious bias is a human condition after all and human perception extends far and wide from person to person.** Unchecked and unaccounted bias will lead to detrimental effects. In the worst case, you may face legal and ethical consequences among inaccurate decisions made using the data collected and metrics produced. Reducing bias is done through strict verifications, transparency, and collecting data representative of the population rather than selective parts of a population to skew results.

You may see two common terms used for metrics of success: Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). OKRs are for tracking progress and setting direction towards specific goals, whereas KPIs are for tracking performance, outcomes, and statuses of one or more metrics over a period of time. KPIs are better suited for tasks done repeatedly whereas OKRs are better for tasks you dismiss or change once reached. OKRs typically use qualitative data while KPIs use quantitative data as well.

As an aside, if there is a metric available, there is a way to “game" the metric or optimize the metric. Though such methods are available, remember your primary goal is whether or not students successfully learn what you’re trying to teach. You may need to meet metrics, but you’re still a teacher at the end of the day.
