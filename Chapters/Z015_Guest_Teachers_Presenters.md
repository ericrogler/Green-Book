# Guest Teachers, Speakers, And Presenters

## Short Answer
These are NOT substitute teachers; they're people, who are not the primary teacher, scheduled and arranged to come in for a limited time to teach one or more topics to your students.

If there's a topic you want to teach you normally cannot teach due to licensure, certification, or disclosure agreements, you may be permitted to have a guest, who is NOT a teacher, come in to teach or present.

Keep in mind whether or not guests are allowed are dependent on administrative approval over teacher approval due to many legal procedures to follow first.

## Long Answer
*Notice: This section deals mainly with education involving minors and younger students, rather than adult students. Adult students in tertiary education may have different procedures I’m not personally familiar with, so I will not speak on them in-depth. I’m also purposely going overboard on some requirements, so you can scale down as allowed.*

Imagine this scenario. You are a music teacher and you happen to be friends with a famous artist, band, etc. For purely example purposes, let’s go with Pink Floyd. I like Pink Floyd and their album The Dark Side of the Moon. They have a lot of credibility when it comes to musical ability and the students get to meet a pretty famous band in-person.

You contacted them, they said yes to coming over, and you have a date and time. Seems all good so far!

Except, well, you’ll still have blockers.

**First, can they legally be in the area you’re teaching?** 

There’s laws where people with specific crimes on their record are restricted from living, being near, or working in school and teaching settings. If they fall under this category, you’re extremely unlikely, if ever, going to get them in the area legally.

**Secondly, have they passed verified background checks?** 

This isn’t something you will normally verify and conduct, but federal authorities, principals, and other support staff inside and outside of the school will do this for personnel in workplace settings. Some schools may have a verified adult list to allow select individuals to do extracurricular activities and/or a list to ban certain individuals as well.

**Thirdly, was it approved by your boss (i.e. the principal/dean/assistant principal)?** 

School settings are strict about which people are allowed and not allowed on the campus, so unless they’ve been given the stamp of approval by administration, they may not be allowed on the campus. 
- There is still a possibility of allowing the guest teacher session, but outside of campus. In this case, you’ll need to worry about field trip procedures and likely require similar, if not more, permissions to go forward with the guest teacher experience.

**Fourthly, did you explicitly define the conditions IN WRITING (yes, get it in writing when possible) for the guest teacher**, such as: 
- How long they’re teaching for with BOTH start and end dates
- Which part(s) of the campus are they using, if any
- What subject(s) are they teaching
- What equipment are they permitted to bring for the classroom and/or NOT permitted to bring into the classroom
- What you, the teacher, will be doing or allowed to do during the guest teacher periods
- Any other stipulations and rules needed to ensure a smooth classroom experience
- What accommodations are needed, if any
- What check-in and check-out procedures are involved at the campus
- To what extent are they permitted to interact with students for activities 
- What happens if any rules are broken and consequences, if needed
- Monetary costs payable to the guest teacher, if any

**Fifthly, were there any monetary costs you need to cover?** 

Don’t forget many guest teachers and presenters are adults and very likely need money as compensation for their work. If you don’t pay them properly the amount they ask for, then they won’t do what you want them to do. Simple as that. If they’re volunteering or doing it for free, then you don’t need to worry about this.

**Got past all the checks! Now what?**

Even if all of these blockers are met, you’ll still have to make sure they also follow the rules defined and set by you and anyone else in the timeframe specified, or else you’ll deal with removing them rather than keeping them in the classroom.

After all of the checks and procedures to make sure they’re allowed in the classroom, it’s similar to a standard classroom but instead it’s them as the teacher and you doing whatever role(s) you’ve defined.

Generally, if explicit roles weren’t defined for you, the teacher. I’d remain in the classroom and in the vicinity of students. This standard procedure helps address any emergencies or concerns the guest teacher is unable or ill equipped to handle. It also protects me, students, and the guest teacher in case of any unforeseen liabilities or situations we did not originally plan for.

**If you want to get a guest teacher or presenter, it’s OK to do–and sometimes encouraged–but make sure you have all the legal stuff and background checks squared away before the time(s) they’re present.**
