# Standards / Objectives

## **Short Answer**

Standards depend heavily on what, where, and how you’re teaching. You may have many standards to follow or not that many, so learn where you can and cannot be flexible on topics to enhance learning. Additionally, you may have to make concessions on topics and time you need for the curriculum.

- **Your main goal here is to meet all standards and go into the appropriate depth on each topic.**

## **Long Answer**

**Warning: Do not skimp or mess around with standards and objectives.**

There’s several reasons why:

- You’ll find it hard to create a curriculum without establishing them
- Some materials you want to use for teaching may not align with the standards
- In the worst case, standards not appropriately covered and taught may put you and others in legal and financial trouble

Once you firmly establish your standards and objectives, *then* you can be creative in your teaching methodology. Objectives and standards need to be ironclad or else the floor you’re building your curriculum on falls through and collapses. Another way to think about standards and objectives is the guardrails for your curriculum; they mitigate you going overboard or focusing too heavily in one area when you need to spread focus across multiple areas. In business terms, it limits your scope.

Though standards and objectives limit what you should do, good objectives and standards will elevate your teaching ability, provide clear direction, and explicitly written measures to evaluate how you’re teaching and if you’re covering what you need to.

Depending on where and what you’re teaching, you might skip most of the curriculum setup and have it dictated by your State and/or District. Other times, you may be given a list of standards to meet and left to create your own curriculum.

If you’re doing an independent series outside of an academic institution, such as teaching people how to cook your homemade pasta on YouTube or a list of recipes and kitchen tools, expect to do most, if not all, of the setup for what to teach and how.

If, however, you’re teaching in a physical environment like a traditional classroom, the answer is *it depends*. Some schools and districts provide a plethora of curriculum materials or even a pre-packaged curriculum from start to finish, while others do not and it’s up to teachers to create a curriculum. In both cases, as well as homeschooling, you’re still constrained by your State’s Department of Education standards and objectives.

If you’re unsure how to find state education standards, your best bet is the Internet. For an example, I’ll use Colorado’s website and search for K-12 academic standards in general.

1. Go to your state’s DoE website (Colorado = CDE)
    1. E.g. https://www.cde.state.co.us/
2. Search for “Academic Standards”
3. Assuming the website is indexed properly, it should be the first result or on the first result page 
    1. E.g. https://www.cde.state.co.us/standardsandinstruction/standards
4. From there, you can select a subject area or look through all standards in one menu 
    1. E.g. https://www.cde.state.co.us/apps/standards/
    2. You can also sort by focus and grade level as well.

For colleges and universities, a similar search process may occur in your specialized or institutional accreditation providing standards you need to follow.

From there, you may find various items, such as grade-level expectations (GLEs), evidence outcomes, connections and contexts, concepts, as well as elaborations.

You may come across other sets of standards (NOT curriculums!) such as NGSS and Common Core as well. These are efforts made by multiple states across the United States, rather than a single state or the nation’s Department of Education alone. They also include advisory and collaboration with outside organizations too, like the National Research Council. Initiatives like these may also be incentivized with federal grants, but not always the case. One important note is individual states may also partially adopt, rather than deny or accept fully, standards made through these efforts as well.

**Before we end, let me re-emphasize two very important points:**

- States and Districts require teachers covering the appropriate standards, but despite doing everything correctly, there are times you need to shorten or summarize teaching certain standards. That’s not always a failure on your part; that’s just life as a teacher.
- A set of standards can be good, but a curriculum using those standards can be poor. The inverse is also true, but significantly more difficult to achieve in my opinion.
