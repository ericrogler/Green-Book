# Action Plan: Month 1

At about Month 1, you should have your bearings in the classroom and how you prefer teaching. You have an idea of what kind of activities to do, how to present lectures, administer tests and quizzes, etc. You’ll also have formed educated guesses and judgments, whether consciously or unconsciously, about many of your students and how they may fare in your class.

At this point, you're going to focus on finer details and further refine all of your processes–not just how you're teaching. Remember, a teacher is a combination of many roles all in one (except therapist). Put another way, you're going to figure out how to develop yourself professionally. As much as I can help you out with this guide, it only sticks if you put it into practice yourself.

**Here are some questions I would consider at this timeframe, if I have not already:**
- Are there resources I haven't considered yet I should look into for teaching?
- Is there a more efficient way to do [thing/process/method]?
- Is there a more effective way to do [thing/process/method]?
- Are students behaving as I want them to?
- If not, what can I do to make them behave better in class?
- Can I still make curriculum deadlines?
- How do I better plan for unexpected events?
- How can I make this topic easier to learn / more accessible?
- Is there a way of learning I haven't explored yet?
- Are there accommodations for students I should provide I have not already given?
- Are there any other problems I need to provide a fix to?

After the first month, you should be closer to a routine schedule rather than playing catch-up, so you have time to go through reflection and self-realization.

For first year teachers, your main goal is survival. When you can get done everything you need, or meet the bare minimum effectiveness, then you can expand from there.

### A Note on Effectiveness vs Efficiency

During your self-reflection period, these terms may come into mind.

Effectiveness and efficiency are two terms used in similar context and fields, but are not interchangeable. It doesn't take a Master’s degree in Industrial Engineering or a Six Sigma black belt to tell you that. I'll spare you a thesis and describe it a few different ways.

1. An effective but inefficient solution solves a problem, whereas an ineffective but efficient solution does not solve a problem.
2. Once you learn that everything is a system of some kind and see what makes effective and efficient systems, you can't help but see inefficiencies in things you couldn't before.
3. Per Peter Drucker in *The Effective Executive*: “Efficiency is doing things right. Effectiveness is doing the right thing.”
