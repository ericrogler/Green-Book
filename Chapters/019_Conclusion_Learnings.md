# Conclusion / Learnings

Teaching is many different fields merged together in a single profession.

There’s also a lot of management involved and you can always improve your teaching over time. The beginning may seem difficult and overwhelming, but it gets easier over time to teach subjects, create curriculums, and people over time.

There’s a plethora of information I skipped over or omitted you may go through as a teacher or instructor, like Professional Development or “How to handle X kid in Y class” because the finer details vary wildly amongst schools, districts, organizations providing the continuing education, and more. There’s also tips and tricks you’ll discover as you get real-world, practical experience that a textual manual like this doesn’t convey the information well enough until you, well, “experience” it yourself.

Outside of that, thank you for reading and I hope you came away from this manual knowing more than before about the world of teaching.
