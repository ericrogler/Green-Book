# Action Plan: Week 1

After the first day, it gets easier. Really, it does. The next wall, however, is getting through week 1 and having everything you need by the end of it done or close to done. 

This week is difficult precisely because everything is still “new” and you may need to spend a lot of time outside work now to save time later. It's like interest and principal on a loan; if you pay extra money now towards the principal on top of the interest, the average interest across all future pay periods decreases.

**Here's some things I'd want sorted, or just about done, by week 1:**

- A document, table, database, etc. with all relevant links to legal organizations, software I'll need to use, resources I'll need for references and supplies, and more.
  - You can update this over time, but get the majority done week 1.
- Student seating assignments (if applicable).
- Lesson plans for next week.
- Knowing how to use the grading system.
- Templates for assignments, quizzes, projects, labs, and tests.
- Ideas for how to approach the unit(s) and topic(s) you're covering (see “Agile Teaching Framework” if confused).
- Any software and account issues sorted with students and you, the teacher.
- Student contact information stored and organized.
- Outstanding payments from students collected (if applicable).
  - If still outstanding, send gentle reminders via email or other contact methods.

Week 1 is where you're setting up your personal teaching database of information; a place you can easily get information from and search for things. This involves cleaning and sorting things first before it's usable, so your first week is OK to sacrifice free time on to get your ducks in a row.

### Lesson Plans (Post Day 1)

After day 1, your principal, or another administrator if not the principal, may have expectations for how much–or how little–to include in your lesson plans. General advice is to follow whatever the principal or your boss tells you so you don't get in trouble. 

**If you don't have a “boss” though, you'll want to check for questions like these:**

- What are the learning objectives?
- What materials are needed, if any?
- What part(s) of the topics are covered today?
- What homework, if any, is assigned?
- What goals am I trying to reach today?
- How long will it take to get through the topic(s)?
- Can I access and utilize the resources needed for the lesson at this time?

If you can answer those questions, you're doing pretty OK. Your lesson plan can be short or long, so long as it meets your objectives and fits within your deadlines.

### Templates (Assignments, Tests, etc.)

Templates are great and they save you time. Instead of writing assignments from scratch every time, you can create one master template for each type of work. A template includes static fields where students write information, like answers, names, etc. and includes dynamic fields where you replace or edit information, like directions, questions, images, visuals, and more.

After the templating stage is done, you’ve effectively cut the time to make every new assignment afterwards in half thanks to the power of copy and paste! A large portion of time is still dedicated to creating the content going in each copy of your template, but that becomes your focus and you can make it higher quality now.

**Again, templates are great. If you can use a template, or make one, do it.** 
- There are cases where you shouldn't use a template, but they are rare and far in-between. You can also template your lesson plans too.
