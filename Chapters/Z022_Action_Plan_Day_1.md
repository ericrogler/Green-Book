# Action Plan: Day 1 
*Notice: This setup is designed for a year long (or semester long) class session taking place at a physical location for primary or secondary education.*

The very first day of a classroom setting. Depending on your timeframe, like if your entire curriculum is done in one day, what you need prepared may change.

**Here are some things I have in the classroom by day 1.** I'm focusing bare essentials over “nice to haves” to balance preparedness with minimal cost and effort plus ability to address many situations:
- Facility access, like keys and scannable ID badge
- Parking space, if you travel by car
- Designated location(s) to teach on campus
- Building layout map
- A list of immediate work contacts, like principal, support staff, other teachers in the department, etc.
- A syllabus
- Basic supplies
  - Whiteboard markers, pencils, pens, paper, sticky notes, rulers, etc.
- Lesson plan for the day and/or first week
- List of standards and objectives for your class(es) taught
- Any additional rules and student expectations
- Seating assignments (if applicable)
- Cleaning supplies
- Desks and chairs (if applicable)
- Utilities functioning in the classroom, such as sinks, fridges, ovens, HVAC, etc.
  - If not, you can submit requests to fix ASAP
- School and/or class schedule
- List of students for the class(es)
- Your account information for computers, payroll systems, work emails, etc.
- Specialist supplies (if applicable)
  - E.g. a class on medicine may need medical supplies ready on day 1
- First Aid Kit (FAK)
  - Trauma kit also fine, but that's overkill for many classrooms unless severe to near-lethal damage possible
- Something to carry your supplies around
  - Backpack, binder, etc.
- Locations of important areas on campus, such as teacher lounge, fridge to store your food, bathrooms, and front office + nurse/health room
- List of software and other tools you need for class on the first day
- N95 and KN95 (or higher grade) masks

This is a large list, but think of it like climbing a plateau. It is steep initially, but once you reach the top it flattens out and is easier to traverse. There are some parts I'll go more into depth on which aren't as obvious.

### Syllabus
This is important information for the student to know about in your class. Depending on student demographics, this can be either simple or more complex in design.

This may include, but is not limited to:
- Learning objectives
- Goals
- Grades / grading distribution
- Late work policies
- Absences
- Exam schedule
- Course content
- Classroom schedule & meeting times
- Required materials and account information
  - For physical textbooks, online programs, etc.
- Information on the course
- Payment methods, payment plans, and monetary costs (if applicable)
- Classroom rules and expectations

By default, a syllabus is not a legal document or contract as it doesn't require the signatures of students or teachers. You should, however, ensure it is readily accessible and understood by students.

### Lesson Plan
This is a written record of what you're teaching. Depending on class intensity your day 1 may go over only the syllabus and expectations, with a possible activity, or straight into the material.

In either case, this is a guide for you, the teacher, to make so you know what you're teaching and mitigate going off track. You’ll also want a lesson plan written to show “proof of learning” in case a student comes back to claim something was not taught.

### Additional Rules and Expectations
Sometimes extra rules and expectations are established outside of the syllabus, depending on your situation, which aren’t related to what or how you’re teaching but other factors, like location or software you’re using.

In both the syllabus and outside of syllabus, the biggest things to keep in mind are:
- You can enforce the rule(s) you make
- The rules are legal
- They fit your management style, when possible, so it is easier for you to enforce and follow through on

### First Aid Kit (FAK)

*Disclaimer: This is NOT medical advice. Seek a medical professional or certified medical staff for further medical questions.*

I've been pleasantly surprised how often a FAK was necessary–even for minor injuries and the occasional request for a bandage.

Keep in mind, as a teacher, you may not administer drugs to students. There are a few cases where it is OK, but they are explicitly defined, narrow exceptions with specific procedures to follow. Unless you can verify and prove you fit one of these exceptions, do NOT administer drugs.

Vaseline, Neosporin, and similar items also contain active drug ingredients, which means you're still administering drugs to students and risking legal issues. This also includes lotions, topical creams, and other oral medicines.

You may think Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Advil, etc. is OK to administer, but it isn't. It still falls under narrow exceptions; if you and the situation don't apply under an exception, don't give it to students. Hospitals and medical facilities also track their use through acetaminophen (“Tylenol”) levels in blood because of how easy it is to acquire and overdose on it.
- **An overdose, even accidental, is a medical emergency that you do not want to cause or be responsible for and can lead to death.**

Some items are in a grey area, such as disinfectants and antiseptic wipes. For those, confirm with a principal, administrator, and/or nursing staff first before using and also confirm the cases where it can be used.

**Some items I found are OK in a first aid kit (FAK) are the following as they aren't administering drugs:**
- Bandages
- Scissors
- Tweezers
- Disposable Nitrile Gloves
- Blanket
- Cold Compress
- Tape
- Gauze

There's several other items you could use which don't administer drugs, but they either: 
- Are unlikely to be needed in everyday situations
- Don't administer drugs, but have specific procedures involved to not cause life-threatening harm instead.
