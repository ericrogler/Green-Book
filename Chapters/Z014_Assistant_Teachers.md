# Assistant Teachers

## **Short Answer**

This category of teachers and teaching assistants are *assisting you*, not taking over for you. If you have them, plan as if you may not have them initially in case they are not available and/or not doing the necessary aid you require.

## **Long Answer**

As I have not worked specifically as one of these roles (at least long-term), I’ll focus on interactions between these roles and a teacher/professors and observations I made throughout multiple schools.

Recall how I mentioned the principal has a significant number of tasks and, when it is sufficiently large in workload, they will bring on people to assist or offset that workload. These are the assistant principals and have tasks delegated to them or specialize in a particular task a principal normally focuses on.

There is a similar relationship between teachers–specifically “general education” and professors–as well as assistant teachers, like “SPED” (Special Education), “Paras” (Paraeducators), TAs (Teaching Assistants), co-teachers, and substitute teachers. The difference between you and them is significant though; even though there may be many co-teachers, there is still a primary teacher–which is likely you if you’re reading this.

### Assistant Teacher Types

**Special Education (or “SPED”)** is a department consisting of 1 or more paraeducators, colloquially called “paras” by staff and students alike. In many states in the US, paraeducators don’t need teaching licenses or credentials, but are still professionals working alongside certified teachers. Each paraeducator focuses on 1 or 2 students at a time with the goal of meeting their IEP/504 requirements. Meeting these requirements ranges from basic assistance to meet the current curriculum students without needs undergo all the way to highly modified curriculums. Paraeducators may need additional guidance on the material covered, as they also have to worry about *your* class + every other class the student goes into.

**Teaching assistants, or “TAs,”** are what their name implies: assistants for a teacher or professor. The requirement for a TA generally is someone, like a past student, with a high success rate/performance in the material you want them to assist with. They do entire lectures, grading, proctoring, lab assistance, answering questions about material, and more. They’re like mini-teachers and their goal is taking off the workload for teachers and professors so the primary teacher/professor gets more time to focus on other endeavors, like research and curriculum improvements. They’ll have familiarity with some of your content knowledge, but probably not familiarity with all the same content knowledge as you. In colleges and tertiary education, TAs may hold lectures and labs with students without a teacher/professor present. In secondary education, they *may not* hold classes without the assigned teacher or a substitute teacher covering the absent teacher(s) present in the area.

- Depending on the subject(s), your TAs may need licenses and certifications to assist you in the classroom. This is on a case-by-case basis as it’s uncommon, but may be required. Check with any relevant authorities or administrative bodies before bringing on a TA.

**Co-teachers** are licensed teachers assisting with multiple parts of a classroom. Of the categories listed, they are the only ones required to have a teaching certificate or license. Their duties may range from splitting all work evenly amongst themselves and the primary teacher, to focusing on paperwork, overseeing underrepresented dynamics, and working with kids with special needs, IEPs, 504s, and disabilities so the primary teacher can focus on students without special needs. Of note with co-teachers, they may have as much training and content knowledge as the primary teacher, but also may not have the same background as the primary teacher. Sometimes co-teachers may be people who can translate your lessons into another language or devise ways to ensure your lessons accommodate multiple people.

**Substitute teachers** are teachers with either a teaching license, a substitute teaching license, or a vetted adult in private school settings. They won’t always have the same background as you do, but in case you need to take time off, they can legally replace you in a classroom setting. Keep in mind they may not be able to teach your subject–unless you give clear enough instructions and they have a background–so they are treated closer to a TA rather than a co-teacher. If it's a substitute who you’re unsure of teaching in your place, the days you are out are better assigned as work days, which are like project/activity days on the framework from before. Be advised though, a substitute teacher fully assumes the role and responsibilities of the teacher they cover, so whatever you can do as the main teacher, they can do much of the same. You place a moderate level of risk in a substitute teacher, as students may not get as far as you intended with them while you are absent. You can get them into trouble with administration though if they do a poor job, and a substitute teacher is expected to leave you a note or short report on how the day went in your classes.

### Handling Assistant Teachers (In-Depth)

Managing assistant teacher expectations and how they assist you depends on communication and expectations. I’ll put it this way: if you’re a primary teacher, don’t expect your assisting teachers to know what to do if you don’t define what they *should* do. 

**Here’s an example list of things to ensure are covered, or at least noted on, when you’re meeting or corresponding with assistant teachers:**

- How to handle special needs students, like IEPs, 504s, and disabilities
- How to split up students (e.g. 2 teachers in one large group, or 1 teacher each for 2 small groups)
- Defining the roles and responsibilities of the teacher and assistant teacher(s) to avoid “overstepping” and determine which people hold accountability
- Decide how much–and which–planning and preparation for the classroom is done by each professional
- Tell the assistant teacher(s) what they need to do during the class
- Pet peeves, goals, support methods, classroom strategies, and expectations
- How much the teacher wants the assistant teacher(s) to help with planning
- How the teacher and assistant teacher(s) can get along with each other
- How to handle meetings with students/other staff and who attends them
- How to split the workload on teaching and preparation *during* the class
- Defining how much assistance is too much for the students and behavior expectations
- Any contact details and who to contact in case of situations, emergencies, etc.

**To sum the above, you need to communicate what you need done and you need to share any and all materials with any assistant teachers.** As for implementation in the real world, teachers and assistant teachers' methodologies and their nuances are as varied as there are a number of teachers in the world. You’ll have to experiment on your own, when you have assistant teachers, on what works best for you, the students, and the assistant teachers.

Additionally, if the co-teacher is newer and needs experience, you’re better off imparting some preparation and teaching work on them rather than keeping them in the background. If their end goal is becoming a teacher, *they need to learn how to be a teacher and not an assistant*.

**Some setups I’ve seen work “well enough” in practice are:**

- One teacher acts as primary and the co-teacher does 1-on-1, or small group, work and assistance with select student(s) to keep as many students as possible on pace with instruction.
- Two teachers split a large group into two separate groups to teach the same thing at a lower teacher-to-student ratio.
- Two teachers split a large group of students into two and cover different specialties within the same subject, such as one teacher going over violins and the other teacher going over cellos.
- A co-teacher who “pretends” to be a student and does the work like students in the classroom, while the primary teacher teaches like they are by themselves, so the co-teacher can communicate questions and relate to students better.
- Primary teacher assumes most teaching duties while the co-teacher focuses on learning aids, accessibility, and translation on the classroom material and topics covered.

With assistant teachers, you’ll want to plan as if they may not even be present–or if present, unable to do work–in the classroom. Things happen, expectations fall apart, communication breaks down; there are myriad reasons for something going awry if it requires 2 or more teachers to do a general lesson instead of 1 teacher. The last thing you need is your job and success heavily dependent on another person.

There are also times where an assistant teacher can make things *worse* for a classroom. If your assistant teacher does something like the following:

- Provides too many answers to questions students supposed to answer themselves
- Talks over you and/or distracts the class with talking when only you should be talking
- Overstepping explicitly defined boundaries.

Then you need to make time for a meeting with that assistant teacher. Said meeting should also be noted down or documented during the meeting or after the meeting. If the issues are severe enough, consider bringing in a principal or HR, alongside any documentation showing evidence of issues the assistant teachers are causing. While they may be in a “teaching” position like you, there is always the risk they are detrimental to your learning environment.

Lastly, I want to go into another category: **a teacher of record or alternative teaching license**. Some states adopt a teacher of record pathway to a license as a means to address teacher shortages during unfavorable times. You’ll still likely need to be part of a teacher preparation program for the license, but you’re permitted to do work in a classroom setting normally reserved for the preparation program. It’s accessible to professionals of other fields outside of teaching to transition into teaching. Keep in mind you’ll still need transcript proof of any subject matter knowledge and may have to pass additional exams, like the PRAXIS. There’s a lot of other requirements in play I’m not privy to and won’t cover on this, but know this pathway to teaching does exist.
