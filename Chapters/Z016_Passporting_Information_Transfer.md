# Passporting & Information Transfer

## **Short Answer**

Sometimes you need to help get a fellow teacher–or substitute teacher–set up in a classroom. You may not have to do it often, but it’s better to know how because you may be forced to do it.

## **Long Answer**

I’ll split this up into two sections: teacher-to-teacher and teacher-to-substitute.

### **Teacher-to-Teacher**

Take for example a new employee is coming in, or a more seasoned one is transferring in for the first time. There’s an orientation period where they’re getting their bearings and understanding the environment. This general process isn’t exclusive to teaching; you may see it in tech, nursing, and other jobs.

Pretend you are the older teacher, rather than a newer teacher. Here are things you may want your new junior to know and have may include the following:

- Contacts for other staff (emails, primarily).
- Building plans, or where things are located in the campus (like a coffee machine).
- How the printer/copier works.
- Where their office/classroom is.
- Technologies and learning systems the faculty use.
- Notes about any particular students to be mindful of.
- How to do shared planning and collaboration among staff members.
- Where to get resources for their class(es), whether electronic or physical.
- What you’re doing to teach X subject (if similar subjects are taught by both of you).
    - You don’t necessarily need to share your whole curriculum, but you can help the other teacher develop one over time.
- What to do in case of emergencies.
- Where medical supplies are.
- Guidelines on what other teachers should be allowed to help the new teacher with.
    - This is so a new teacher isn’t too coddled and allowed to teach on their own.
- Any soft skills they should be mindful of.
- How to observe their classrooms (if needed).
- how to set up coverage (substitute teachers, etc.).
- How to build routines, establish behaviors and rewards, and management.
- Any plans for check-ins for newer teachers, like weekly meetings, collaboration sessions, etc.
- Ways to provide more time to “catch-up” on teaching duties.
- Class Schedules
- Who you’re working with, whether it's by department, smaller group, etc.
- Access to the room(s) they’ll be using
- Sample Lesson Plans
- Instructions for grade/attendance/reporting system(s)
- What are organizations new teachers need to interact or have a line of communication with for parts of their curriculum

It’s a long list, but keep in mind you’d want a teacher to stick around rather than be stuck in the mud. If you’re able to get a new teacher standing on their own feet, then they will cause fewer issues for you as well. It’s a mutual benefit for all involved. You could even include almost all of this on a single Google Document to distribute out.

### **Teacher-to-Substitute**

For people taking over your class on days/times you’re unavailable, it’s more like you’re giving them a laundry list of things to watch out for and how to manage that class. The rule of thumb is the simpler the plan, the more likely it will be followed.

It could be simple like “here’s worksheets; make sure they do them” to something complex. Remember that whoever comes in as a substitute may not know your subject area, so plan accordingly. It is possible your substitute may not even read your plans, which means you might have to post the work online or distribute worksheets and hope the students do the appropriate work.

Despite the simplicity, or complexity, of substitute plans, you’ll want to make a “standard” template and an emergency substitute teacher plan. This is to ensure you don’t get in trouble and also where you don’t have the ability to create plans for a particular time frame. Substitute teachers are permitted to information normally protected by FERPA/HIPAA so long as it pertains to your classroom, but they are on a “should know” basis rather than “may know.”

Here are some things you should note down and divide by each class/subject for the times you are unavailable in these plans:

- A work plan of what the class is doing during the time period(s).
- Any important notes about students that need to be revealed to the substitute.
    - E.g. Medication times, who has learning plans like IEP/504, etc.
- Noteworthy students with extra classroom roles, such as a student stepping up as a conductor in a music class or student assistants actively helping in the classroom.
- Any passwords, access codes, and permissions needed to properly run the classroom.
- Who to contact in case of emergencies/help.
- How a classroom is managed.
- Your email, or a way to contact you.
    - Avoid giving out your phone number unless absolutely necessary.

**An example of a work plan for a classroom may be set up this way.**

- Students do [Assignment] today.
    - Available on [Platform/Medium] located [Computer/Desk/Etc.].
    - Work is turned in [Online/Physical Location/Kept].
    - Expected to complete [In-Class/Out-of-Class/Partially done].
- Additional Resources: [Link(s)]
- If students finish all work early, have them do [other assignment(s)].

Only put down information relevant for a substitute teacher–or another teacher in general–to know for these plans when you’re gone.
