# Case Study: Communication Lesson

*Notice: You can copy and modify this template. This is based on an activity I actually did for my own students in Science classes.*

### Objective 
Students will examine a case study and learn how to communicate and present to a larger audience. The assignment will test their ability to identify why the presentation is effective, what elements assisted in the presentation, and what was special about the topic presented.

### Time Distribution
**~50 minutes total**
- ~5 minutes for Teacher prep and administrative tasks beforehand
- 15 minutes for video
- 15 minutes to complete questions
- 15 minutes for classroom discussion over answers and presentation
- Any remaining free time is dedicated towards further discussion

### Accommodations
- For hearing impairments, turn on closed captions (CC) in the video.

  - If there is an interpreter present with the student(s), permit the interpreter to assist with the questions and follow along with classwide discussion.
- For sight impairments, base grading on their level of active participation and how well they answer questions you ask. 
Avoid asking them questions dealing with heavy visual elements.
- For physical impairments, have seating available for these students if not already available.
- For writing impairments, you may permit them an electronic copy of the assignment to type their answers on. They’re still required to participate in discussion, however.

### Standards
- [Teacher defined; may vary depending on grade level, subject, etc]

### Questions
*Student Notice: For all questions, assume answers need to be in complete sentences unless stated otherwise.*

- What elements were integral to Steve Job’s presentation? List 6 different elements you spotted in the video. No complete sentences needed.

- What did you notice about the way he spoke and the types of words and sentences he used?

- On his presentation slides, what were the maximum number of words seen on any slide?

- How were visuals used to accompany spoken and written words?

- At what points were the audience the most excited? Why were they excited?

- What features of the iPhone were you the most interested in during his presentation? Why were you interested in those?

- **Extra Credit:** What feature received a low amount of applause, but is still an important feature of the iPhone? Why?

### PAUSE

**When done, wait for the teacher to signal the start of classroom discussions. If done early, review and refine your answers above.**

### Discussion

**Steps to follow:**
- The teacher provides 5 minutes for students to discuss the answers amongst themselves. 
- After 5 minutes, the teacher provides information about the presentation itself, gradually answering some, if not all, of the questions.
  - This process take 10 minutes, depending on the question amount.
- If done early, teacher may do one of these options:
  - “Free time” for students until class dismissal
  - Ask “improv” questions about the presentation to the class
  - Allow early dismissal (if permitted by principal/school policy)
  - Ask the students how they would make their own presentation on a topic of their choice, using the concepts and themes shown in the video.
