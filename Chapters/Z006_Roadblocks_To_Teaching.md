# Roadblocks To Teaching

## **Short Answer**

**There’s four types of blockers I’ll define:**

- Technical
- Physical
- Monetary
- Interpersonal

These blockers depend heavily on whether you’re in a physical classroom, online, etc. as well as what equipment you have, what you can afford, and the disposition of students being taught.

## **Long Answer**

In a teaching environment, you’ll experience several types of blockers I’ll address below. Some blockers are within your control and manageable, while other blockers are outside of your control and either restrict access entirely or require circumnavigating around to reach your intended goal(s).

For simplicity’s sake, I’ll try my best to sort blockers into four categories.

### **Technical Blockers**

In one sentence: is there a device that cannot operate the software and/or perform the tasks I need for teaching?

*If no, proceed with whatever plans you have; you’re good.*

*If yes, it’s a blocker and you either:*

- Cannot use it
- Need to find an alternative with lower technical requirements

For example, you may want to showcase Crysis on a Chromebook, but the computer doesn’t have the specifications to handle it. Instead, show you can run Doom on a Chromebook and it solves a similar problem with a more efficient (and probably free) solution.

Another example is you want students to use school-provided equipment to operate a flight simulator, but you discover, probably through “dxdiag” on a Windows computer, the specifications are nowhere near good enough. That’s OK though, because there are browser alternatives which are less resource-intensive.

**Be warned though:** using alternative software may not meet all of your needs or accurately do what is needed to meet your objectives. As long as Plan B works and does what you need, it’s good enough. You can always supplement other materials related to the subject(s) to fill in gaps.

The only time you are *stuck* with teaching a given software is if you’re trying to get students to earn a certification or licensure with it. You *definitely* cannot use alternatives with those; it’s either use the required software or they cannot get the certification or license. Some software also require the teacher to hold a license or certificate to legally teach the software and/or administer tests to earn the licenses and certifications, so you’ll need to double check that first.

### **Physical Blockers**

These blockers refer to the space you’re teaching in or from. They can also refer to the physical limits of what humans can and cannot do.

Perhaps you need a certain type of room or equipment, but the area you are in cannot support it or it does not have the proper connections, like natural gas pipes, wide open center space, or high voltage outlets, to support your teaching equipment.

Some physical blockers you can easily deal with, such as moving around desks and chairs in a room. Other physical blockers are significantly harder or costly to deal with, such as installing new windows or installing a new engineered wood raised platform in the middle of a room.

With a bit of creativity and ingenuity, physical blockers are not as restrictive as other types, but have influences on how students act and pay attention. You could teach an entire classroom with everyone standing, but then taking notes, drawing, or writing is significantly impaired as a process. You could also isolate people across the room or do rows of desks instead of desk clusters, but then you influence how they may interact with each other as well as you the teacher.

A rarer example of a physical blocker is if you have students with disabilities, but the area is grandfathered in through building codes and has no ADA compliant ramps or access, meaning that a student cannot enter your classroom by themselves. You could consider:

- Provide assistance to get them into the classroom, whether by yourself (very legally risky) or request other students to help (less legally risky)
- Hosting the classroom in a different location to solve physical restriction issues
- Provide alternative forms of learning and accommodations to solve learning issues

For the example above, I would personally consider if it is possible to provide assistance into the room through another student, followed by alternative learning forms. The other solutions are either legally complicated or unable to occur due to a multitude of other blockers like space, money, etc.

There are countless more cases of physical blockers, but your overall goal with any space is this: Rearrange the physical space to best deliver the material and expertise you want to teach.

For online spaces, the goal is similar but add guardrails and ways to stay focused on you, the teacher, to mitigate people deviating away from the material you’re actively teaching.

### **Monetary Blockers**

You can accomplish a lot with sufficient funding, More often than not, however, you don’t have the appropriate funds.

When funding is limited, be ready to resort to low-cost or free alternatives, or omitting types of learning requiring either online or physical payments to use. Fortunately, thanks to advancing technology, you can do most things at a low price now, if not entirely free, through software like Notion, Google Documents, Google Sheets, DBeaver, pgAdmin, and Visual Studio. Some planning software for teacher use, like Planbook, is also low cost or free as well.

There are multiple types of websites–government, commercial, non-profit, and personal–with free simulations and interactive software available for student and public use, such as [**NASA's Eyes**](https://science.nasa.gov/eyes/) for solar systems and [**USGS TopoView**](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/) for topographic map viewing and manipulation.

With some software though, such as ArcGIS, Revit, and SolidWorks, you may need to purchase Educational and Student Licenses. These are *not* cheap, but typically cheaper when bought for educational and student use compared to business, personal, and professional use.

Be aware, however, there are strict requirements for what the businesses providing the software consider as an educational institution–if you do not meet them, you may not utilize them and need to search for other, preferably free, alternatives.

### **Interpersonal Blockers**

There’s not much you can do with these, but think of interpersonal blockers as things like societal issues, cultural fit, as well as gender, political affiliations, and more. There’s plenty of red tape and blockers you cannot avoid, so be mindful of how you navigate the many relationships you have with coworkers, students, peers, and more.

If your facility or learning environment has an HR department, generally just follow the guidelines and rules they tell you to follow and you should be, for the most part, good to go.

If you don’t have assistance or a HR department, here’s things you should avoid in a classroom and teaching setting for your own protection:

- Politics
- Religion
- Sexism
- Harassment
- Anything that intentionally–and unintentionally–causes physical harm to others.
- Bullying and bringing down people through your words and actions
- Relationships with students
- Relationships (in general)

What’s the relationship between weightlifting and people? You lift up weights and you lift up people’s knowledge. You want to lift other people up, not put them down, and you want to maintain a safe, acceptable, and respectable distance between you and your students.
