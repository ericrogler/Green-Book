# Maintaining Your Health

## **Short Answer**

You are human, so you have human needs you also need to fill. Leave work at work whenever you can.

## **Long Answer**

Many teachers are likely to work outside of their contract hours; the hours of the day you’re “supposed” to be at a school performing duties. For first year teachers, it’s nearly inevitable because you’re designing everything from scratch. If not going from scratch, then you’re spending more time figuring out how the systems work. For more experienced teachers, the amount of time outside of work you get back gradually increases because you can do things faster and require less rigorous setup for your classes; you’ve had *years* to fine tune everything.

Here are things to watch out I’ve personally had to be mindful of. Some parts are repeats of what I said before, but if I’m repeating it, *it’s for a good reason*:

- Get enough sleep.
- Whenever possible, do NOT work outside of your contracted hours.
    - If you need to volunteer for things, do not volunteer for too many things all at once.
- If you can get around a third to a fourth (6 to 8 hours) of time to yourself–and family, if you have one–each day, that would be ideal.
    - Your hours are about 8 hours each day, and potentially up to 1 to 2 hours of travel each working day.
- Make grading easy for you and automate it if you can.
- There’s times taking 1 hour to work on something, then a small 5 minute break, gets it done faster than spending 2 hours continuously working on it.
- Do NOT sacrifice your health for a job. If it is dangerous to do, avoid it if able.
- You will have good days and you will have bad days. Sometimes the bad days will ruin your entire day and the best course of action is to try and focus on something else–outside of work–on that day.
- Chances are, your first year in a teaching environment you’ll get sick because you’ll be exposed to more germs and bacteria as usual.
    - Stay up to date with shots & vaccines.
    - Reduce exposure when you can.
    - Wash hands before leaving the workplace.
    - Have hand sanitizer somewhere within the room or area you’re working in. Don’t always use it though; sometimes hot water + soap works better.
    - Have a FAK (First Aid Kit) handy in case of minor emergencies.
    - Keep disinfectant/sanitising wipes in the area you’re working in as well.
- Exercise, even a little bit, will help keep you in moderate shape. Even walking is fine.
- Since COVID, wearing a mask won’t be seen as weird as it was in the past and you can use it if you’re in higher risk health environments. If there’s multiple students coughing, then definitely wear a mask even in normal environments.
- Ensure you’re meeting nutritional needs, such as vitamin and calorie intake.
- Manage stress.

If you’re in a position where you also happen to be teaching basic health (not advanced health and medicine; leave that to health professionals like nurses, doctors, and dieticians), you can look into sources such as the CDC, NIH, and nutrition.gov as starting references.
