# Money and Budget Management

## **Short Answer**

**Money is a resource you may not have enough of when teaching. Be careful spending it.**

## **Long Answer**

While I did talk about monetary blockers briefly before, I’m creating a separate section because money permeates every facet of teaching, either directly or indirectly. Your wage is also affected by money.

**If teachers are managers, then each class you’re teaching is a project you’re overseeing.**

- Students are employees doing the tasks by learning and showing proof they learned properly.
- You have an assigned budget for supplies, equipment and materials–mainly provided by the school, PTO/PTA, or investments.
- You’re organizing the workload distribution (units and topics in your subjects taught) through a set period of time, with a strict deadline.
- You have to make sure students are doing the work and not causing excessive issues amongst each other. There is behavior management involved.

Teachers are managers, it turns out. Another role you have, though it is not explicitly said too often, is managing money. If you don’t have money, or spend it all unwisely, you may not have the supplies to teach. Unlike managers though, you typically don’t deal with all the nuances of budgets and money; that’s up to the principal(s) at your institution.

### Covering The Budget
Now then, your “budget,” which comes in different names, such as PTO allowance, learning budget, classroom budget, and more. For consistency’s sake, I’ll refer to it as “learning budget” going forward. Unless you’re teaching outside of a normal educational institution, your spending limit is defined by someone else, like your principal, and not you. Additionally, the items permitted to be covered by that learning budget are not up to you; instead, this is defined by your federal government (namely IRS), the principal, and/or any organization providing the funds. Even if you’re not subject to principal control, you are very much subject to IRS control. If you’re part of a non-profit, you also have stricter requirements on what can and cannot be paid for *in general*.

This amount varies wildly across institutions, but I’ve seen ranges from a couple hundred USD ($200) to several thousand USD ($3000+), *per year*, granted as a learning budget for a teacher. For some schools, this may come from a source known as a parent-teacher association (PTA) or a parent-teacher organization (PTO) who provide grants and approve purchases and materials teachers buy. From personal experience, as long as you’re getting only supplies they’ll cover–or able to get them to cover, if you fancy negotiating or presenting a case/need for something–you won’t have much difficulty getting it covered. If you’re still low on budgetary needs, you can also look into third-party organizations, such as Adopt a Classroom, but I won’t discuss those in depth due to how varied they are.

Outside of groups like PTA and PTO, state and federal budgets also affect your learning budget–and by extension, your school budget. At the state and federal level they define an overall budget and it goes through the funnel of districts and principals to finalize the budget each teacher, including you, gets for the classroom. A school or institution may provide complementary currency, virtual currency, digital assets, or sectoral currency as well, such as online currency valid to use only on Teachers Pay Teachers.

Typically, where a teacher puts the learning budget and funds into are some of the following below. There’s significantly more examples, but these come to mind first:

- General classroom supplies
- Books
- Lab equipment
- Furniture and decorations
- Software Licenses
- Multimedia equipment
- Computers/Laptops
- Office supplies
- Paper
- Online learning materials

Because this is a manual on teaching and not budgeting, I’ll avoid going into details on how to manage the budget. As long as you don’t carelessly spend money and realize the budget needs to last for the entire teaching period, you should be OK. Generally speaking, when buying things, you want to look for the following:

- Any deals or significant savings
- Items that aren’t immediately needed by you you can get in a timely fashion
    - This is called “lead time” and is the time between order placement to order delivery
- Items you can plan out in advance to purchase
- Items not easily obtainable without purchasing them
- Things that are safe (or safe enough for science) in a teaching environment

### Putting It Into Practice (Budgeting for Newbies)

**If you're not sure how much you should spend, forget about whatever learning budget you have and pretend you have only 100 USD (United States dollars).** It's probable you can have the essentials and basic supplies you need for a classroom with that amount, like pencils and paper. 
- The only exception to this 100 USD limit right now is for any ONE item you need for teaching–not the physical classroom–that is >=100 USD.
- Keep in mind these items you buy can also be just for you, the teacher, and not for student use.
- If the school/facility provides something you need in general, you could get away with not buying your own version and save money.
  - E.g. don't get a laminator machine or a printer if your facility already has a working one. 
- You also don't need to spend all 100 USD. If you get everything you need with less money spent, that's totally fine and saves you more money.

As an aside: use a credit card instead of a debit card if able. You'll have more protections in case of fraud or another negative event happens, plus get benefits when used properly (**[Further reading from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/050214/credit-vs-debit-cards-which-better.asp)**).

Once the first 100 USD is spent, stop and ask yourself if there are any other essentials you need. 

Set aside some money to replenish essential goods throughout the year, then the other part of your budget you can use up for other items and goods you may need and lower priority items. 
- I’d set aside 50% of my budget at first, but your mileage may vary 

If it's near the end of the year and you need to reach net zero–where you spend up your entire budget on purpose–then you can tap more into your savings to purchase teaching and classroom supplies for both this teaching period and future teaching periods.

**Your learning budget is supposed to last the entire teaching period, whether that is a year, semester, or otherwise.** If you spend it all at once, then you're in for a bad time. Also remember to keep your receipts and ensure items in your budget are reimbursed whenever possible, so you don't pay out-of-pocket if you don't need to. Chances are you can get your school–and sponsors and grants–to get you the funds as long as you can show it's necessary for teaching.

**Remember: Never pay out-of-pocket unless absolutely necessary and don't go above your allotted learning budget whenever possible.** You don't have to spend a lot of money for a good teaching experience; only as much as you need.
