# The Use of AI

### [Previous Chapter](Z019_Money_Budget_Management.md)

## **Short Answer**

**Don’t use AI for learning if students do not know how to use AI safely and properly.** It is still a tool you, as a teacher, should learn about, plan for, and utilize because it is not going away any time soon.

## **Long Answer**

**Here’s two questions for you:**

- “How does one use AI correctly and safely?”
- “How do you know what AI generates is true and correct?”

**If you cannot answer these questions, that’s OK, but I will tell you that you shouldn’t use AI yet. If you do have solid answers, that’s good.**

For those with a math or science background unsure where to start or new to AI, I’ll point a finger at [Google’s Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) on AI/LLMs.

For those with less technical backgrounds, here’s what I’ll say AI is in simple terms:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) takes data and information, tries to find patterns and relationships within it based on prior knowledge (i.e. what it’s trained on), and generates results from its findings.

Before continuing, I’ll emphasize important points about AI which mirror my views on it.

- No matter what you use AI (and LLMs) for, you are ultimately responsible for it. If you use AI, you MUST verify its output is correct, otherwise you’ll be in trouble.
- Don’t feed it sensitive data, like medical records, legal documents, credit card statements, and/or confidential information in general. It can use, log, and transmit that data into a public space and put you at risk of fraud, theft, and more.
- Sometimes doing it manually is faster than getting AI to do it for you.
- Even with all of its advantages, the use of AI can remove learning opportunities and retention of information.
- Your students WILL use AI if able to. Make plans for its use and when it happens.
- You don’t always have to incorporate AI into a classroom. It’s a tool, like any other.

That said, AI is a complicated topic. The velocity, volume, value, variety, and veracity of AI development increases year after year, month after month, and much of what I say could be invalidated within less than a year, if not 5 years. According to Simon Willison, on his Weblog in June 2025, the past six months (December 2024 to June 2025) *alone* there were multiple advancements in AI, including but not limited to:

- Amazon’s Nova models
- DeepSeek V3
- Meta’s Llama 3 Series
- Mistral Small 3
- Many, *many* more

**I find teachers fall under three categories of AI usage:**

- No AI use to Casual use (Checking out ChatGPT infrequently)
- Casual use to Moderate use (Infrequent to regular use of ChatGPT, Deepseek, OpenAI)
- Moderate use to Heavy use (Using multiple AI models / LLMs and/or teaching on it)

Most teachers I’ve seen are in the first two categories. Third category I’ve seen is mainly teachers in engineering, computer science, or software development and the rare teacher outside of those fields. What is not likely to change though is where AI applies to teaching and students specifically. Here are some examples I’ve seen and would categorize below.

| **AI Okay** |
| --- |
| • Repeating redundant tasks normally done manually
• Generating concepts, examples, and ideas for humans to expand on
• Streamlining administrative tasks
• Compare submissions to answers for quick grading
• Students with disabilities are explicitly allowed to use it to help them learn
• To record and practice voice lines which are transcribed into text |

| **AI Not Okay** |
| --- | 
| • Completing assignments for students
• Providing AI confidential or classified information
• As a replacement for learning something new
• Using it as a substitute for critical thought and problem solving |

As a stern reminder, anything listed under “AI OK” still requires a human to verify its accuracy and ensure what is done is what you intended.
