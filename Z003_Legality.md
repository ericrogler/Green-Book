# Legality

### [Previous Chapter](Z002_The_Actual_Overview.html)

## **Short Answer**

*Notice: All information in this chapter is NOT legal advice.*

What rules you must follow depends on location, subject, and employer.

Tertiary education (colleges, universities, etc.) and secondary education offering college courses may operate under different rules compared to primary and secondary education.

## **Long Answer**

Legality protects both your students and you as a teacher and determines what you can teach.

First, the obvious. What is a law is still a law you follow in the classroom.

As for the less obvious, it depends on your area's jurisdiction. I'm most familiar with the state of Colorado in the United States, so my examples are from there and I will use Colorado as my primary reference for this chapter. Other states should have different organizations and/or the same organizations serving the same roles. If outside the United States, other bodies like a national education department or judicial group(s) may serve these roles instead.

Using the State of Colorado as an example, I had some level of interaction with these types of organizations and laws. I don't expect to list or remember every organization, act, and law here; only a sample.

**Federal/National Level**
- U.S. Department of Education
- U.S. Federal Court and Copyright Office
- U.S. Department of Justice
- U.S. Department of Labor
- American Council on Education (ACE)
- Department of Public Safety (Mandatory Reporting)
- HIPAA/FERPA
- Fair and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)
- Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
- Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)
- General Educational Development (GED)
- Title VI and Title IX
- Child Protective Services (CPS) (also at state level)
- International Baccalaureate (IB/IBO)
- ACT
- College Board (SAT, AP, etc.)

**State Level**
- Colorado Department of Education (CDE)
- District Offices
- School Boards
- Recording and Consent Laws

**Other Classification**
- Software Organizations
- Service Agencies
- Contractors

For high schools with specialized tracks, colleges, and universities, your list may include, but is not limited to, accreditations necessary for licensing and job requirements, such as:

- Higher Learning Commission (HLC)
- Western Association of Schools and Colleges Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC)
- Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)
- Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)
- National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB)

### **Education in School Types (Overview)**

Education is a responsibility of the state, including its public and private organizations, to establish, fund, and maintain schools and education (Colorado Department of Education, 2022). "State" means states like New York, Kansas, and Colorado, not the United States as a country. For this section and onward, I'll use state of Colorado regulations as my examples.

Of the organizations listed, the CDE plays the broadest role in Colorado education. District offices and school boards oversee individual public, private, and charter schools, but the CDE sits above them in legal hierarchy. The CDE serves multiple roles, such as (Colorado Department of Education, 2025a, 2025d):
- Defining and regulating different school types
- Defining rules for home-schooling programs
- Overseeing student protections, medical health, and accommodations
- Issuing licenses and certification requirements 
- Establishing continuing education requirements
- Implementing state education laws and policies
- Providing guidance for instructional materials
- Enforcing state-wide laws related to education

There are exceptions to what education facilities and programs the CDE holds direct oversight on, notably private schools, but they are not fully exempt from all CDE regulations. They still abide by many CDE standards, such as building standards, health, basic education, and attendance requirements (Colorado Department of Education, 2013). In case the CDE has issues, the U.S. Department of Education also keeps track of state regulations, like Colorado's, on locations like their ed.gov website (U.S. Department of Education, 2025).

Teachers interact mainly with their respective district offices and school boards, which are regulated by the CDE. Districts and school boards typically oversee items like the following, in addition to any CDE/state regulations:
- Permiting learning materials like textbooks
- Approving curricula for various subjects
- Allowing or disallowing technology use, like applications
- Defining additional rules and regulations

Private schools follow different rules from public schools, allowing them more freedom for internal affairs, curriculum, and teaching methods. Despite this increased freedom, the CDE considers private schools as private/small businesses instead of educational institutions (Colorado Department of Education, 2025c). This means the CDE cannot accredit or endorse private schools, hold jurisdiction over their operations, nor act as a custodian of a private school's records and transcripts. It also means a private school may technically employ teachers without teaching licenses, but a public school cannot.

The CDE also oversees and supports online public schools and online education programs in general, performing roles like facilitation, creation, and quality control (Colorado Department of Education, 2025e).

Independent instructors may use platforms like YouTube, Udemy, and Coursera for their content. These platforms likely deal with the U.S. Federal Court and Copyright Office, as primary issues there are DMCA, Fair Use, copyrighting, and more. For these platforms, it can be as simple as making a video or presentation on a topic you're passionate about and want to share with others. Rather than traditional educational bodies, you'll deal primarily with the rules (and monetization requirements) of your hosting platforms as well as U.S. Federal Courts and the Copyright Office to protect any content you or other creators made.

There are some online courses separate from educational institutions that count towards college credits, such as IBM Professional Certificates endorsed by the American Council of Education (ACE), but where they count towards credit varies significantly and is outside the scope of this discussion (Coursera Staff, 2025). Nevertheless, be aware that they do exist.

### **Student Protection Laws**

*Notice: This is for the United States only.*

In most cases, students, teachers, and staff deal with FERPA and HIPAA. FERPA and HIPAA are safeguards for people's personal information, such as address, first and last name, gender, and other personal identifiers (PIDs and PIIs). You cannot share this information outside of specific cases, such as other teachers in your school, law enforcement, public health, EMTs, and the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the relevant student(s) (CDC, 2024). Sharing information with professionals in outside organizations, even other teachers not a part of your school, may also violate FERPA/HIPAA in certain circumstances.

For more information on FERPA and HIPAA, see the following links below:

- [https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/index.html)  
- [https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/ferpa-hipaa/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/ferpa-hipaa/index.html)  
- [https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/ferpa-and-hipaa/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/ferpa-and-hipaa/index.html)

Per the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (2020) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (2024), the FERPA and HIPAA relationship stems from the fact that educational records covered under FERPA are excluded from HIPAA, but both cover personal information. They both have their own set of regulations when it comes to disclosing health information as well.

In a teaching position, expect to follow FERPA guidelines more than HIPAA guidelines, but you'll still need to abide by both laws.

### **Student Disabilities and Accommodations**

For students with disabilities and accommodations, you'll be expected to adjust your lesson plans and curriculum to meet their needs. Sometimes this is easy to do and other times this is extremely difficult to accommodate. 

In the United States, the most common accommodations I've personally seen are Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and Section 504 Plans (504s). States, like Colorado, may have guidelines for Individualized Health Plans (IHPs) to cover specific health needs and treatments (Colorado Department of Education, 2025b). Sometimes there are Behavior Intervention Plans or Behavior Support Plans (BIPs and BSPs), but I've encountered them less often in comparison. Each plan addresses physical, mental, medical, cognitive abilities, education, and learning ability.

In practice, these plans are typically satisfied by school staff with two methods: service hours and specific accommodations. Service hours are the amount of instructional/support time a student is entitled to while specific accommodations are supports/modifications provided for a student's learning.

Per the U.S. Department of Education, there are explicit standards on IEPs and 504s. To summarize, an IEP focuses on modifying the instruction/delivery of material/content and establishes specialized goals and milestones. In contrast, a 504 focuses on changing the environment in which learning occurs (e.g., seating arrangement, extra test time, etc.) due to limits in major life functions and impairments (Schultz, 2022).

IEPs and 504s have nationwide resources available, whereas IHPs have info at the state level. Here are a few links for future reference.

- [https://sites.ed.gov/idea/topic-areas/#IEP](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/topic-areas/#IEP)  
- [https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/individuals-disabilities/section-504](https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/individuals-disabilities/section-504)  
- [https://www.cde.state.co.us/shs/individualizedhealthcareplanprocesspdfjune2019](https://www.cde.state.co.us/shs/individualizedhealthcareplanprocesspdfjune2019)

IEPs and 504s are legally binding and require signed agreement from all parties. It shows every party entered into it willingly and verified their approval of it. Every party involved, including the student (if applicable), teachers, parents, and administrators, must follow the plan, or they may suffer legal consequences for non-compliance.

Initially establishing one of these plans is not always your responsibility as a teacher, but meeting the plan's accommodations and understanding a student's specific needs are a teacher's responsibility. Additionally, these plans can change over time and are not immutable for the entire student's learning journey.

Keep in mind these plans account for a student's *learning.* These plans do not grant students qualified immunity from consequences when violating school rules and other laws, such as assault, bringing a weapon on campus, and battery.

Another important note: you also cannot tell other students, even in the same class, that one of your student(s) has an IEP/504. That also violates FERPA because students don't have a legitimate, educational need-to-know basis for that information.
- By extension, you also are heavily restricted on asking about any medical conditions related to the accommodations as well.
- The only potential way around this is if the student, or parent/guardian depending on their age, discloses details of their own IEP/504/etc. and conditions publicly. That's when it's waived, but you're still only allowed to say what is now public knowledge.

### **Mandatory Reporting**

*Notice: This is primarily for the state of Colorado.*

Teachers (among other professions) are legally required to report **suspected** child abuse or neglect to the appropriate hotline (Childcare.gov, n.d.). Reports may vary by state, but typically go to the local Department of Human Services, Child Welfare Division (Colorado Department of Public Safety, n.d.). After filing a report, the investigation is then handled by CPS and law enforcement.
- What may be defined as child abuse and neglect can differ across states.
- For Colorado, you can refer to resources like [Child Welfare Information Gateway's information](https://www.childwelfare.gov/resources/definitions-child-abuse-and-neglect-colorado/) as its a United States government website (2025).

*Generally speaking*, it's safer to report and be wrong (type 1 error or false positive) than stay silent and miss abuse cases (type 2 error or false negative).
- **As a caution:** Failing to report or intentionally filing a false report may result in misdemeanor or felony charges depending on jurisdiction (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2019).

### **Teacher Protection Laws**

There's various laws in place to protect you, the teacher, in case of incidents. There are also times where you'll need to go "above your manager" or outside the chain-of-command becauses of work environment issues or for legal compliance with authorities. Because of the quantity and variety of these protections, I won't explain every single one of them.

These protections may be useful when reporting direct violations of laws, like sexual harassment or civil/criminal misconduct, or times where the principal/manager is unable to provide a safe work environment. There are various organizations overseeing these protections for both public or private employees, such as Public Health and Safety organizations in each state and OSHA at federal level. In addition, retaliation laws may apply if you lose your role as a result of taking action (U.S. Department of Labor, 2025).

In addition:
- The process may take an extended time to complete.
- You can press crimial charges against students as well, but the [ages juveniles receive charges as an adult](https://www.juvenilecompact.org/age-matrix) varies across states (Interstate Commission for Juveniles, 2025). 

### **What about showing and using content like YouTube videos in a face-to-face classroom?**

If you want the long answer, it's *probably* OK under Title 17 of the United States Code (). There's also three separate sources to refer to:
1. [Title 17](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/)
2. [17 USC 106: Exclusive rights in copyrighted works](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title17-section106&num=0&edition=prelim)
3. [17 USC 110: Limitations on exclusive rights: Exemption of certain performances and displays](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title17-section110&num=0&edition=prelim)

As for a short answer, as long as the following apply, it's *likely* permissible:
1. Physically done at a non-profit educational institution
2. Part of face-to-face instruction (not online!) and a part of instructional standards/objectives
3. Shown specifically in a classroom/instructional space
4. Not streamed or uploaded publicly
5. The video itself is lawfully made by its creator and streamed directly from YouTube
6. It doesn't conflict with YouTube's own terms of service.
7. No admission or fees are charged for showing it in the classroom

Keep in mind Title 17 is a *primary* source. Other laws may still supercede it like organizational contract terms, Fair Use, DMCA, and more.

Again, this isn't legal advice; it's a summary of what educators and copyright experts interpret for copyright exemptions in classroom use. For better guidance, refer to public legal literature or a qualified expert in copyright.

### **Social Media and "The Blame Game"**

In a teacher role, you're usually the front line. If something goes wrong, you're often the first person blamed because you're easy to reach, limited in defense mechanisms, and convenient to blame.
- From personal experience, these issues usually come from people with little power over their own lives given the chance to shift blame and exert power over another person.
- These issues also typically stem from chronic non-performers who refuse to do work or follow directions then look for external issues to justify failures.

Additionally, social media is not always your friend. Besides potentially violating FERPA/HIPAA, you aren't necessarily protected in saying whatever you want. If you have a "spicy" political opinion, you shouldn't post that in written form and have it drafted as evidence against you in a court of law.

For case studies related to social media and speech, I see these three cited often:
- [Pickering v. Board of Education | 391 U.S. 563 (1968)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/391/563/)
- [Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District | 393 U.S. 503 (1969)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/393/503/)
- [Garcetti v. Ceballos | 547 U.S. 410 (2006)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/547/410/)

### **Teaching/Instructional Contracts**

If you're a teacher or instructor, it's likely you also signed a contract. The particulars vary widely from place to place, so I'll say just this:

- Read every line of your contract.
- Contracts may specify who owns what you create.
- You may be allowed to ask the administration drafting the contract about specific clauses, but do it with grace.

**The point is always read contracts carefully.** If there's something in a contract you don't know about, fix that ASAP.
