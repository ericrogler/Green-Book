# Legality

### [Previous Chapter](Z002_The_Actual_Overview.md)

## **Short Answer**

What you legally follow depends on your location, subject, and place of employment.

Undergraduate and graduate education like colleges, universities, and post-graduate programs–as well as secondary with college courses–have some different rules to follow compared to primary and secondary education.

*Notice: The following information above and below is NOT legal advice.*

## **Long Answer**

Think of legality as a way to protect your students and you. Yes, *you* need legal protection as a teacher. What is legal and not legal dictates whether or not you can teach what you’re teaching.

First, the obvious. What is a law where you’re located is still a law you should–and need to–follow in the classroom.

As for the less obvious, you’ll need to search for it. I’m most familiar with the state of Colorado in the United States, so my examples are from there. If you’re elsewhere in the United States, the exact organizations will differ but still serve similar roles. If you’re outside of the United States, you may have something like the Department of Education and other federal judiciary organizations for your sovereign state.

Using the state of Colorado as an example, I had some level of interaction with these types of organizations and laws. I don't expect to list or remember every organization, act, and law here; only a sample.

- Colorado Department of Education (CDE)
- U.S. Department of Education
- U.S. Federal Court and Copyright Office
- District Office (Traditional Classrooms)
- School Boards (Traditional Classrooms)
- American Council on Education (ACE)
- Software Organizations and Service Agencies
- HIPAA/FERPA
- Fair and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)
- Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
- Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)
- General Educational Development (GED)
- Department of Public Safety (Mandatory Reporting)
- Child Protective Services (CPS)
- U.S. Department of Justice
- International Baccalaureate (IB)
- ACT
- College Board (SAT, AP, etc.)

For high schools with specialized tracks, colleges, and universities, your list may include, but is not limited to, accreditations necessary for licensing and job requirements, such as:

- Higher Learning Commission (HLC)
- Western Association of Schools and Colleges Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC)
- Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)
- Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)
- National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB)

Education is mainly considered a responsibility of the State, including its public and private organizations, to establish, fund, and maintain schools and teaching. This generally means states like New York, Kansas, and Colorado, not the United States as a country.

Of the organizations listed earlier, the CDE deals with Colorado education the most from my personal experience. District offices and school boards are tied primarily to private schools, public schools, and colleges. The CDE covers all of those organizations *and* other areas, such as homeschooling, student protection, mental health education, and state assessments to name a few examples. They also issue licenses and set the standards teachers must meet to maintain their certification and standards teachers follow on their curriculums.

Traditional teachers also deal with District Office and School Boards, as those entities expand upon standards District Offices and School Boards set for teachers. This includes, but is not limited to, a District deciding what textbooks or expanded curriculum to implement as well as approving which software is used and taught to accommodate subjects like science, literature, reading, writing, mathematics, and history.

Private schools have separate clauses and statutes they follow compared to public schools. This allows private schools more freedom for internal affairs and what they teach–and how they teach–but the CDE neither endorses nor accredits private schools, which means some avenues for funding and public support programs are cut off.

Some online public schools and programs are overseen, supported, and endorsed by CDE. They may also include in-person activities with other students in those programs, but typically a student is online for 80% of traditional school hours.

Unofficial and licensed teachers and instructors may also utilize and create content on platforms like YouTube, Udemy, and Coursera. These platforms are most likely to deal with the U.S. Federal Court and Copyright Office, as primary issues there are DMCA, Fair Use, copyrighting, and more. For these platforms, it can be as simple as making a video or presentation on something you like and want to teach others. Rather than traditional educational bodies, you’ll deal primarily with the rules (and monetization requirements) of your hosting platforms, like YouTube or Udemy, as well as U.S. Federal Courts and the Copyright Office to protect any content you or other creators made.

There are some online courses separate from educational institutions counting towards college credits, such as IBM Professional Certificates endorsed by the American Council of Education (ACE), but where they are counted towards credit varies significantly and is outside the scope of this discussion. Nevertheless, be aware they do exist.

### **Student Protection Laws**

*Notice: This is for the United States only. Other nations I’m unaware of and I won’t speak on.*

Generally speaking students, teachers, and teaching staff will deal with FERPA and HIPAA. FERPA and HIPAA are safeguards for people’s personal information, such as address, first and last name, gender, and other personal identifiers (PIDs). You cannot share this information outside of appropriate parties, such as other teachers in your school, law enforcement, public health, EMTs, and parent(s)/guardian(s) of the student you talk about. Also it’s safe to assume speaking to another professional with your same role/title, but each party is in different organizations, about this information may also violate FERPA/HIPAA.

For more information on FERPA and HIPAA, see the following links below:

- [https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/index.html)  
- [https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/ferpa-hipaa/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/ferpa-hipaa/index.html)  
- [https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/ferpa-and-hipaa/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/ferpa-and-hipaa/index.html)

The FERPA and HIPAA relationship comes from how educational records covered under FERPA are excluded from HIPAA. They both have their own set of regulations when it comes to disclosing health information as well. In addition to personal information coverage, FERPA *also* covers educational records as well.

In a teaching position, expect to follow FERPA guidelines more than HIPAA guidelines.

### **Student Disabilities and Accommodations**

For students with disabilities, as a teacher you’ll be expected to adjust your lesson plans and curriculum for them. Sometimes this is easy to do, such as making an electronic version of an assignment instead of a physical, and sometimes this is extremely difficult, but legally necessary, to accommodate, such as planning for medical emergencies.

In the United States, the most common accommodations I’ve personally seen are Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), Section 504 Plans (504s or 504 Plans), and Individualized Health Plans (IHPs). Sometimes there are Behavior Intervention Plans or Behavior Support Plans (BIPs and BSPs), but they're less common based on anectodal evidence. Each plan addresses physical, mental, medical, cognitive abilities, education, and learning ability.

An IEP/504 are also legally binding documents. It shows every party has entered into it willingly and provided their signatures as verification. Every party written inside of it, including the student (if applicable), teachers, parents, and administrators, must follow the plan or they may suffer legal consequences for non-compliance.

To summarize, an IEP focuses on modifying the instruction/delivery of material and establishes specialized goals and milestones, while a 504 focuses on modifying the environment the learning occurs in (e.g. seating arrangement, extra test time, etc.). An IHP is independent of these two and focuses on special medical conditions and what can be reasonably changed to meet those.

IEPs and 504s have nation-wide resources available, whereas IHPs have info at the state level. Here are a few links you can see for future reference.

- [https://sites.ed.gov/idea/topic-areas/#IEP](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/topic-areas/#IEP)  
- [https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/individuals-disabilities/section-504](https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/individuals-disabilities/section-504)  
- [https://www.cde.state.co.us/shs/individualizedhealthcareplanprocesspdfjune2019](https://www.cde.state.co.us/shs/individualizedhealthcareplanprocesspdfjune2019)

Establishing one of these plans is not always your responsibility as a teacher, but meeting the plan’s accommodations and knowing the accommodations a student needs are a teacher’s responsibility. Additionally, these plans can change over time and are not set in stone for the entire student’s learning journey.

### **Mandatory Reporting**

If you’re a teacher or professor, you’re also a mandatory reporter. Mandatory reporters are LEGALLY REQUIRED (I cannot stress this enough) to look out for signs of child abuse and neglect and contact the appropriate hotline. The exact contact varies by state-to-state, as laws for handling this are decided mainly by the state, but every state follows similar mandatory reporter laws and requires you to ensure with certainty a report is made to the local Department of Human Services, Child Welfare Division.

**As a caution:** If you fail to report, you may face fines and imprisonment. In some states, you can face felonies for not reporting. In the same breath, however, you can face either a misdemeanor or felony for intentionally sending in a false report, depending on the state you’re in.

You are both required to report signs and report them *knowing beyond a reasonable doubt* that abuse or neglect is happening. This also applies if you *suspect* child abuse too. For your safety, an investigation after reporting falls under CPS and law enforcement.

### **Teaching/Instructional Contracts**

If you’re a teacher or instructor, high chances are you also signed a contract. The particulars vary widely place to place, so I’ll say just this:

- Read every line of fine print in your contract.
- You are also allowed to ask the administration drafting the contract about certain clauses, but do it with grace.

More importantly, the contract may explicitly spell out whatever property or material you make belongs to whom. In many cases, materials you make for teaching or utilize may belong to the establishment, district, or school and not to you. In rarer cases, you may be safe to use materials you make at one location and use, distribute, or teach at another location without much issue.

**The point is:**

- **Read. Contracts. Carefully.**
- If there’s something in a contract you don’t know about, fix that ASAP.
