# Conclusion / Learnings

### [Previous Chapter](Z025_Case_Study_Communication_Lesson_Example.html)

Teaching is a combination of many different fields in a single profession.

There's also much management involved, and you can continually improve your teaching over time. The beginning may seem complicated and overwhelming, but it gets easier over time to teach subjects, create curricula, and work with people.

There's a plethora of information I skipped over or omitted that you may go through as a teacher or instructor, like Professional Development or "How to handle X kid in Y class," because the finer details vary wildly amongst schools, districts, organizations providing the continuing education, and more. There are also tips and tricks you'll discover as you get real-world, practical experience that a textual manual like this doesn't convey the information well enough until you, well, "experience" it yourself.

Outside of that, thank you for reading, and I hope you came away from this manual with a deeper understanding of the world of teaching.
