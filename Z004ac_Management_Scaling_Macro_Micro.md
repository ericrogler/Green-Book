# Management Case C: Macro and Micro

### [Previous Chapter](Z004ab_Management_Scaling_Operations.html)

## **Short Answer**

Management, at scale, shares some problems and logic with video games and real-time strategies: limited resources, simultaneous operations, and balancing short-term tactics with long-term strategy to meet goals.

Macro (Macromanagement): Strategy, such as resource allocation, system optimizations, workflows, and scaling infrastructure to support operations.

Micro (Micromanagement): Tactics, such as controlling and moving around people, assigning specific tasks to those under you, coaching, resolving bottlenecks, and feedback loops.

Too much micro or macro negatively affects overall effectiveness and efficiency. The levels of hands-on control vs delegation should be balanced out to maximize effectiveness in environments. Management challenges scale as you go from oversight on one location vs multiple locations, which adds in more problems related to coordination, information flow, and strategic alignment.
- The optimal ratio of micro vs macro depends on your environment, but it is rarely, if ever, one dominating the other entirely in practice.
    - In real-world terms, a manager who micromanages (or even macromanages) excessively is, objectively, a bad manager.
- If you're spending too much time doing the jobs of other people, you won't have enough time to do your own job and you suffer as a result.

## **Long Answer**

This chapter may seem foreign to readers unfamiliar with video games. For those familiar with video games, you're more likely to connect with concepts presented here. Because of this imbalance, I'll avoid being overly technical, but except multiple new terms.

If you've ever played a RTS (real-time strategy) or city builder video game before, then many of the concepts there apply to management. If you've ever been a raid leader in a MMORPG, many of those concepts also apply to management. If you read the last chapter (Management Case B) on operations and milsims, any leadership position there also counts!

For most of this chapter, I'll write primarily towards the viewpoint of a RTS/strategy game player.

### **Rock, Paper, Scissors**

In many games like these, strategies counter other strategies. Simply put: If an opponent plays one way, you play another way to achieve victory.

This principle applies beyond units and personnel to include tactics, resource management, and logistics behind the scenes.

How to typically determine which hand to play is through scouting and maintaining vision of the playing field and your opponent. If you're aware of what the opponent(s) are doing, you can develop ways to beat them. At the same time, denying your opponent knowledge/vision over your activities reduces their effectiveness in countering strategies and tactics you deploy.

Developing a sense for when to use what strategy/tactic at what time comes with experience, but is essential to dealing with myriad situations. If you're not used to how a match plays out, what your enemy can do, and what you can do with your resources, you're not going to perform as well as you should.

One of the biggest mistakes you can make is establishing wrong, or no, expectations of what your opponent can do. For untrained or unprepared players, their build order deviates and turns what is a potential victory into a likely defeat. Despite this, you still need to learn to manage expectations and adapt to overcome issues they bring.

If, however, it's a case where your opponent isn't a person, but rather an environment, like in some city builders, many concepts don't change that much. Instead of worrying about opponents sending units to disrupt operations, you're worrying about the effects and variables the environment throws at you. This requires practice like before as well as appropriate pre-planning and safety net development to "weather the storm."
- For example: If nature's hand is "rock" and it decides today is wildfire day, your "paper" strategy to counter it is a fire suppression system to control it.

While strategies may not perfectly deflect or mitigate *all* potential damage to your systems, a proper strategy is significantly better than an inappropriate strategy or no strategy utilized at all.

### **Opportunity Cost**

Opportunity cost = (Return on best alternative) – (Return on chosen option) 
- Paraphrased from Investopedia's article on opportunity cost (Fernando, 2025).

One of your main goals is to minimize opportunity cost throughout the entire match and every moment in that match. Rarely, if ever, will you make every perfect decision possible in a single game, so the cost is always greater than zero. You can, however, practice to reduce errors and improve decisions over time.

Additionally, every action can snowball. What seems like a small cost or error at first when you make the decision potentially cascades down the line and creates a larger delay. Taking 1 second to produce units could mean upgrading tech 1 minute faster.

This is balancing decisions across economies, upgrades, armies, and other variables. If two players used the same strategy against each other, the player with a small boost in any one of these areas gets a potentially significant advantage over the other player.

### **Macro vs Micro**

Macro is significantly more important than micro. It's an area many people make mistakes on as they prioritize insignificant contributions. 80-90% of time should be on macro and managing build orders, strategies, economies, and monitoring the area for what opponents do. Micro should only be a fraction of time spent as units can perform most functions without your direct intervention or continuous oversight.

A human being cannot focus their attention on more than one thing at a given moment. Even if they could, the level of precision and finesse drastically decreases for all things done simultaneously. You can have multiple tasks going all at the same time though, which is what a methodology like Critical Path Analysis helps to solve and optimize.

It's why distracting opponents works as a defensive technique and a set-up for an offensive technique. If the opponent falls for the distraction, it's what they focus on instead of their original goal, which gives you more time to focus on your priorities to achieve victory.

Distractions force mistakes and create advantages, which provides chances to achieve victories.

### **The Macro(management)**

This is your backbone, your strategy, your core build order. It's the primary guide and routine you follow, which you know by heart, to achieve victory and meet your goals. It should account for achieving constant production and efficient resource use. Ideally, there should be no blockers, no idle work, and no missed opportunities.
- If there's a point where you're not doing *anything,* you're probably doing something wrong.

Never forget that core routine *must* be adaptable. It has to account for emergencies, deviations from the norm, and more. A rigid macro strategy, even a great one, can crumble if it cannot adapt to changing environments and unexpected scenarios.

You can generate multiple routines as bases for different types of scenarios, but you should have one core set at a minimum.

The only way to reduce anxiety and making mistakes is through well-defined planning, properly established contingencies, and practice. Theory can refine your moves, but practice mitigates the chance you cannot commit when push comes to shove.

That isn't to say theory should be neglected either. If you lack proper knowledge on capabilities of units, what tools are available, and what systems are in place, you'll mess up in several ways including, but not limited to:
- Resource misallocation
- Wrongly assigning deadlines
- Tactical blunders

Knowledge of the environment is important. Equally important is what's feasible in the environment.

### **The Micro(management)**

This is the part where you're maximizing unit value per second (or other unit of time).

To put it another way: Say you tell someone they need to clean the dishes. Your part in micro is issuing the order here, while the other parts (scrubbing, cleaning, putting the dishes away), are accomplished by the person without any further intervention.

Your micro load increases when going beyond the initial request and overseeing each step the person makes. While you could ensure everything is done exactly as intended, this is often wasted effort and rarely ever needed beyond the initial training a unit gets in the task. Excessive direct intervention wastes productivity of all parties involved, not just one or the other.

There *are* cases where extensive micro is useful, but it is rare and far in between. Generally speaking, a commander or leader should only be issuing orders, and information relevant to complete the order, to units without further intervention and letting the units accomplish the "task" to the best of their ability.

As stated before in macro, you still need to know theory and what your units are capable of. If you don't know what they can (or should) do, you cannot effectively micro(manage) them to reach full productivity and achieve your goals.

There's also a term called "trading" where you're balancing the supply costs of your own units vs the opponent's units and determining your gains and losses by supply efficiency. 
- If you engage an opponent and you lose 12 dollaroos compared to their 8 dollaroos, you still lose based on how much value you lost (12 vs 8).
- In other words, your opponent accomplished more with less and have a more efficient army.

### **Relating Back to Instruction**

Now, let's tie strategy and macro/micro to teaching/instruction.

Macro is like establishing a curriculum and lesson plan from where you teach material to students. It's also developing a classroom management plan you can reference for yourself and students so you have ways to deal with contingencies and other emergencies (more on classroom management in another chapter!).

Your focus *should* be on macro ~90% of the time in a classroom session as your primary goal is instruction! If you're not spending the majority of time in instruction, then something is very likely wrong.
- An exception to the above would be activities, where instead of instructing you're letting students do activities or labs on their own with some guidance. 
- In that case, the ~90% goes towards putting out fires and ensuring the class is focused on the activity.
- If this were a manager outside of education, that same portion of time should be getting rid of blockers and setting up systems for employees to do tasks effectively.

Micro is when you're discipling particular students, answering questions in the middle of instruction, or stopping instruction or other tasks to help students inside of a classroom. Assuming classroom management and appropriate systems are in place, this should ideally take no more than 10% of your time in a classroom session. While some micro may be necessary, too much focus negatively affects your goal of guiding and instruction the class *as a whole.*

You also need to balance opportunity costs. This comes in many forms, like choosing a specific teaching method, determining when to intervene, and handling disciplinary issues. These costs may also come in accommodations, where you decide between ways to legally satisfy accommodations. Each decision carries a cost compared to its alternatives, whether it is time, attention, or resources which could go elsewhere.

Teaching and instructing is, overall, a balancing act of maintaining systems, managing individuals, and minimizing opportunity costs. While you could have one core strategy to solve these issues and reference, you may be required to create multiple strategies, or significant derivations, to legally accommodate students with IEPs, 504s, and other requirements.

Your ability to prepare, adapt, and scale, as well as learn what requires your attention, is important for a successful classroom environment.
