# Teacher-Client Relations

### [Previous Chapter](Z012_Homework.html)

## **Short Answer**

Teaching and instruction involves working with people. If you cannot do this well, you'll struggle. If you treat your peers well, you'll (likely) get treated well in turn. At the same time, peers may treat you poorly for reasons out of your control and not your fault. You'll need to learn how to work with people you disagree with, or force their issues upon you, without taking things personally.
- To put it plainly, teachers may be treated like punching bags by parents and other adults as they're the visible "frontline" of education people *can* reach.

Goals are often, if not almost always, mismatched amongst different roles. To keep it simple:
1. People above you (e.g. managers, administration) care about outcomes and communication.
2. People beside you (e.g. employees on same "level") care about technical expertise and knowledge.
3. Consumers (e.g. parents, students, etc.) care about quality goods and services for their time/money.

Goals can greatly differ amongst peers as well. For example, with two people in the same role, someone may seek technical excellence/perfection while another wants to ship things out and get results fast.
- "Resume driven development" may be a goal you'll see as well.

Teachers and instructors, or any particular person/group, are not exempt from *also* being the problem. Every person can cause issues, but rarely does every person cause issues simultaneously. 

A lot of advice assumes people are rational and not crazy. In practice, that's rarely the case. Read many things with a grain of salt.

## **Long Answer**

Diplomacy is the strategy and tactic to master relationships with others. Threatening litigation, or another similar act, is when that working relationship immediately ends and it's time to bring in the attorney.

Sometimes there are problems people already know how to fix but the main thing stopping people from fixing it is, well, other people. 
- E.g. A status quo (existing environment) may persist because people still benefit from it.

The amount of information you can display about students (the *legally* allowed information, obviously) is staggering. In most schools, at least in the United States, interested parties like parents and adult students have 24/7 access to grades, progress reports, schedules, and more, but will still complain about not getting enough notice and a lack of communication.
- The amount of time a teacher spends per day with a student is not a reasonable fix, despite people thinking it is. That's not the teacher's issue at that point.

Sometimes convincing your boss (or other authority figure) is as easy as having the problem(s) happen to them too or giving them front row seats to the chaos.
- Key word: *Sometimes.*

### **Perceptions and Stereotypes**

Bias is unavoidable, ever-present, and unlikely to go away anytime soon. Everyone has unconscious bias and it's your role to identity which biases matter and how to adapt to them. It's the things people don't *say* they do, but still do it anyway–the unknown knowns. 

You might also hear this mentioned as stereotypes and this applies to many things, such as gender, race, and more. It affects how you handle things like classroom management and is often out of your control and shaped by the dynamics of the environment people grow up in.

I'll stick with one example here: gender.

Gender shapes perceptions of teachers, whether people admit it or not. Male teachers often have more authority in discipline and less backlash on appearances, but face more scrutiny on what they say and do. Female teachers may provide more support networks and have lower fears of retaliation, but may be more likely to face sexual assault, misogyny, and have their appearance and classroom authority questioned by students, parents, co-workers, administration, and more.
- I've seen, multiple times, male students treat female teachers worse, but male teachers better, despite both sets of teachers sharing the same roles, responsibilities, and skills.
- Small aside: these same dynamics may occur to non-teachers and professionals across multiple fields too.

With gender, teachers and professors are not classified as a "bona fide occupational qualification" (BFOQ), so you legally cannot discriminate by gender for who gets into a teaching role in the United States ([Further reading on BFOQ](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/cm-625-bona-fide-occupational-qualifications)) (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 1982).
- Notice: BFOQ is an *exception* to existing laws, [like Title VII](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964) (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2009).

Should this happen in a teaching setting, from anyone, then keep the following in mind: 
- Judge based on the values, actions, and conduct of a person; not their background.
- Notions on respect and disrespect towards someone regardless of gender, etc. can be taught.

### **Administrators**

Principals, deans, and assistant principals are your "boss." They're like directors or higher level managers. They oversee school performance, budgets, staffing, policies, public relations, personnel management, and more while under the jurisdiction of their District and the Department of Education. They also handle things teachers may not want to deal with, like most complaints, legal issues, and multiple meetings.

They have a lot of real power over you, but often have hands tied outside of their control for reasons like state and federal regulations and legal consequences for actions. 

A primary goal is to ensure good PR for the facility (or facilities) they manage and avoiding lawsuits. This may mean bending the knee to demands both reasonable and unreasonable.

They want the school to perform well and they hold a large responsibility for its success or failure. The District and Department of Education also have a vested interest and want good returns on the investment they put into the school.

For smaller schools, you may need only a single principal and the teachers may pitch in to cover deficiencies. For larger schools, you'll still have one "principal." Still, many roles are divided or partitioned out amongst multiple people, such as assistant principals or deans. These roles assume some duties similar to a principal, but focus on specific duties (such as discipline), groups of students (such as finance major students), or specialized administrative tasks (such as Legal Counsel and HR Manager). The principal still has a hand in the affairs of everything at the school and has a surprisingly large amount of legal power.

As a teacher or instructor, your role, in their eyes, is to produce the results the principal(s) need you to achieve with your students. Outside of that, when dealing with administrators as a teacher, you want to do the following:

- Follow chain of command
- Stay calm, polite, and respectful
- Document interactions (in writing when possible)
- Bring solutions, not just problems, whenever possible
    - No one likes complainers
- Ask clarifying questions, not state raw opinions, on decisions they made
    - Also prepare evidence to inform decisions you support, if applicable
- Keep gradebooks and lesson plans updated
- Make their job easier and they'll usually make yours easier in turn

Another interesting reality about teachers and principals is potentially misaligned goals. A teacher may, validly, focus their goal on educating students. A principal may focus on meeting graduation rates and test scores as their goal. Your goals, despite both of you working towards showcasing high levels of student learning, will probably not align and you'll have conflicts over teaching methodologies as a result. Expect and prepare for when that happens.

Overally, your best bet is becoming a more effective teacher, improving your curriculum, resolving issues independently, and improving professional relationships with students and staff.

### **Parents & Adult Students**

I think of parents (and guardians) as apple trees. They're a significant influence on all students you're dealing with. It was true while I was an active teacher and still true today. 

Parents are also the closest thing teachers/instructors have to "customers."
- ...Which means they're "always" right, even when they're beyond a doubt incorrect.

Imagine you own a business, but you're a teacher. Now imagine your "clients" are the parents of your students or, if old enough to be legally independent, the students themselves. Sometimes your administrator will support you in handling this category. Other times, they'll side with parents to appease complaints or keep the peace. It depends on the administrator and it's less something you can easily change.

The goal of most parents is opportunities, success, safety, and learning for their children. A parent's logic is not the same as normal logic; what seems rational to parents may not seem rational to non-parents. To achieve this goal, parents should work with, not against, teachers and educational staff.
- There's also legal consequences as an incentive. In multiple states in the United States, as of June 2025, "failure to educate" is potentially grounds for mandatory reporting under the definition of neglect (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2025).

When handling parents of students, you'll want to keep records of interactions, how policies are enforced, and evidence of learning (whether positive or negative). You may also request administrators or a second colleague to show up to meetings with them to act as a witness if there are potential issues with meeting them.

For adult learners, treat them as students and not friends. You aren't as age-restricted on what you can say, but everyone, teacher and student, have more legal responsibiity and freedom compared to younger students. Boundaries and professional demeanor still matters.

With everyone involved here, you'll want to set expectations from day one, if not even earlier than day one. It saves you time and also quickly establishes the environment they're dealing with.

**I also cannot stress enough: parents hold significant leverage.** They're like customers paying to use your product/service. Adult students have similar dynamics to parents, but more based on their own interests rather then their children's interests. Parents also spend significantly more time with students than teachers ever will, so their influence on said student's behavior and actions, as well as the environment they raise the student in, is much higher.
- **Simply put, the *parents* typically break or make a child's life, education, and future.**
- The parent and their child (a teacher's student) should be told "no" sometimes to protect themselves, their children (students), and the entire education system from irreparable damage.
- From personal observation: a problem at school with a student is typically a problem at home with parents, especially with students showing consistent/persistent bad behaviors.

If I were to describe some ways parents can negatively affect their children's views of education and performance in school, it'd probably say some of the following:
- Too much screen time (or technology overly used to pacify children)
- Scared of their child being bored or unhappy
- Solving problems for the child instead of letting the child solve them
- Controlling social interactions too much
- A lack of interest in said child's education
- Maintaining negative views about education and particular subjects, like math
- Always, and/or immediately, fixing any uncomfortable situation or getting rid of obstacles
- Not reading to kids or at least encouraging kids to read

There's also the parent(s) who claim there's nothing they can do after trying everything. More often than not, it comes from parents where their children still have their phones, drive themselves to school, can freely spend money, have access to video games, etc. In other words, they don't enact punishments which affect what the child, your student, values until behavior is fixed.

Without parents and their children, school enrollment drops, funding soon follows, and schools cannot operate effectively. The power of speaking with their wallet is far-reaching. Parents may also make complaints and reviews out of ignorance or without consideration to the resources and constraints of educational systems. Though they are complaints, they still lead to decisions which, for better *or* worse, affect education as a whole.

What this means is educational staff across multiple organizational layers may make decisions to keep parents, and also donors by extension, satisfied, even when it conflicts with educational interests. It may not always be your principal, or you, who enforces this, but instead someone with influence or a group higher up the chain-of-command making the decision for your organization. You also may not see the negative consequences of these decisions for years to come, but they could be still be happening in the present.

Lastly, the ideal scenario is a parent's child, the teacher's student, is never written up or they receive a communication from education staff about their negative behaviors. If that occurs, that is almost always happening *after* multiple intervention methods were tried and failed. That now means the parent is expected to exercise their rights and privileges as a parent and enforce consequences for the student's actions. A permissive parent in this scenario will backfire on everyone, including the student, in the education system.
- If there is no structure, consequences, and expectations for students, don't be surprised when a child/student cannot function in a society later on in life.
- This scenario also does not immediately mean said student is being "targeted." The Earth revolves around the Sun, not the parent or the student, and teachers have to balance this one student with every other student and moving piece in the classroom.
- Depending on the parent(s) response, they may or may not be reported for failure to educate.

### **Other Teachers**

You'll almost certainly work with other teachers. If the school is small, you may be the only teacher present for a particular grade or field of expertise. If the school is larger, you may be amongst other professionals in similar areas to what you're teaching, like multiple engineering professors in a single department.

In any of these cases, you'll find yourself working with teachers of varying skill levels, experience, and backgrounds. Other teachers are your allies, resources, and sounding boards to check your sanity. You can share ideas about how to operate classrooms, but respect their downtime.

Avoid talking about sensitive topics like religion and politics unless you're sure the other teachers you're around are OK with civil discussion on those topics.
- Even then, be wary of talking about these topics in public and private spaces. Who knows who is listening in.

Lastly, if you're planning events for teachers where they receive something or gifts are involved, like a catered lunch, give a heads up and/or inform in advance when it happens.
- This can apply to other professions, but especially true for teaching and roles where chaos can occur at any given time throughout the workday.

### **Secondary & Primary Education Students**

**Why do students fall under clients? It's because they're the ones receiving your services: the material you're teaching them!** 

That's where the comparison to clients/customers stop with them, because this section talks about minors. They're strictly considered children unless they're the legal, adult age.

There are two consistent truths I observed with students (young *and* adult) in classes.
1. The best students are held accountable at school, home, *and* outside of school in general.
2. Students lie to avoid doing "work" and to avoid consequences.
    - A major reason why I say to collect evidence and document events.

If anyone tells you a student is an angel, or smart, or some similar comment about how they never cause trouble, don't believe them at first. That type of comment is typically a red flag. If a student were truly smart or benevolent, they'd also be smart enough to know not to cause behavioral issues. I've also seen cases where smart people are extremely good at manipulation of staff, peers, etc. to get what they want as well.

This category mainly applies for students still considered minors. The biggest thing to note is minors don't follow the (exact) same rules as adults when it comes to learning. Sometimes, younger students genuinely do not know any better because they haven't been *taught* any better; you're often working with a (mostly) blank canvas.

As for managing them, a general rule of thumb: the more things students are kept busy with or doing inside of a classroom, the fewer behavior problems they'll cause. It's harder to cause issues when they're dealing with something else right in front in them, so to speak.

For students in general, you want to go in with as few assumptions as possible; the fewer, the better. Here are some assumptions you can safely make about students, but also be ready to change them if needed:

- They may not know the material you're teaching
- What seems easy to you may be complicated for them
- There are emotions and feelings that a student may not be able to express well
- They may not be familiar with the same tools you are familiar with (like computers)
- They may not follow your instructions well and/or correctly the first time

Think of teaching like sales. If material is engaging and desireable, students buy into it. If not, they won't buy into it despite any tangible benefits provided. Some students may view activities more negatively, but objectively, in terms of payoff vs time and effort put in.

One strategy I've used is explicitly asking the students what kind of activities they want to learn and do within the limits of the curriculum. This method ensures they have a way to "buy in" or invest their time into what I'm teaching. For already motivated students, this won't do as much. For students on the fence or less motivated, it's like providing a free side with their entree, which may boost their motivation and increase the chances of buying in.

It is possible students bring in factors you may not be able to fix or fall outside initial assumptions. These may include lack of accountability, apathy, learning accommodations, and more. They may refuse to do things and also refuse to use the accommodations provided, even if legally required to make available to said student(s). There's only so much you can do for these cases, which is why documenting learning efforts and interactions with students is extremely important in case someone claims you didn't appropriately perform your duties as a teacher.

Additionally, it's also easy to tell signs of when a student has too much screen time and/or not enough time to sleep. Some examples, which lead to that conclusion from personal observation, include the following:
- Sleeping a lot *in class* (poor sleep hygiene/management).
- Parroting video phrases (not saying examples here to spare reader sanity and stay safe-for-work).
- Talking constantly.
- Being unable to engage in non-screen activities.
- Abnormally short attention spans.
- Immediately trying to access technology when entering class, except when explicitly required for the lesson(s).
- Adopting speech patterns mimicing online video personalities too closely.
- They quickly become bored and cannot accept delayed gratification.
- Meltdowns and refusals when there's no access to computers, phones, etc.

...This list could go on for quite a bit. Overall, students with behaviors and issues like these may also have issues with learning, cause issues inside the classroom, and potentially have overlap with, or mask, other unseen or unsaid issues. Additionally, these issues are typically the result of their environment enabling or normalizing them, intentionally or not. That environment can include parents, teachers, student peers, and other people reinforcing patterns.

While parents and relatives may think *their* student is special, classrooms typically have anywhere from a handful to dozens to hundreds/thousands of students at once with other students who may also be considered special. 
- If every student in the classroom is special, then none of the students are special. 

Teachers are operating under time and resource constraints, which means they have to focus on equity and practicality to ensure fairness and material is delivered to as many students under their care as possible.

Lastly, remember to be friendly, but keep professional boundaries, between you and your students. You are in a position of authority over them, like a manager over an employee, and they also have to report to several *other* managers (i.e. teachers and sometimes administrators) at the same time. This typically means they're juggling around several different classroom management plans at once rather than a single one across all classrooms.

### **Support Staff**

Last, but certainly not least, are your fellow support staff. These are people who work in the same environment, school, etc. as you, but aren't necessarily your manager/boss or a teacher like yourself. Support includes secretaries, custodians, maintenance staff, paraprofessionals, security, nurses, cafeteria staff, groundskeepers, and more.

Without these staff members, your school wouldn't be able to keep rooms clean, offload specialized tasks from your own workload, and maintain a safe and orderly environment. Many support staff also focus on arranging substitutes to cover for you when you're absent as well. Without them, you may have to take on more administrative tasks. In short, **they help *you* do *your* job–albeit indirectly.**

To keep it simple, treat them well or expect bad conditions and more work very quickly for you.

### **Handling [Adult] Communications and Urgency**

How do you know when something is important? I have some indicators:

1. It has a deadline.
2. It has consequences if not done (defined elsewhere or explicitly in a communication).
3. It can be verified whether or not *you* did it.
4. It has specific information (this part can be short or long in length).
5. It's been asked about more than once.
6. It's *probably* not sent as an email/text message.
7. It's a life-threatening and/or medical emergency.

Your first year of teaching/instruction, you're likely not going to "know" if something is important, so go through the process of responding as usual and figure out what things are actually important. Even in my first year of teaching, I didn't "figure it out" until at least several months in. I don't expect you to be perfect from day one. 

When you develop an intuition for it, you'll learn to better protect your time and what to prioritize.

Next question: How often should you check things like your email every day?

If you're in a line of work like communication, social media, owning a business, or a manager, this is pretty often. If your primary work is NOT communicating, then you should plan out specific times of the day to look at emails, etc. and what days, like vacation days and weekends, to NOT look at emails, etc.

There's also some "rules of thumb" to emails/texts I like to follow:
- Keep it short
- Reply only during work hours unless *actually* urgent
- Some personalization
  - E.g. "This student said they" -> "[Name of student] mentioned [pronoun]..."
- If it avoids a 1 hour meeting, I'm making a 5 minute email
- [If the sender sends low-value messages like these, I'm ignoring it](https://nohello.net/en/) (No Hello, n.d.)

Over time, you'll develop the intuition for what matters and when/how to respond.

### **Professional Developments (PD)**

I have mixed opinions on this. These comments could apply to other professions, but I'm focusing on teachers/instructors here.

In every professional development or administrative presentation, however, I want the person *to just get to the point.* There's no reason to ever infantilize *other adults;* students or minors aren't attending these events but other adult professionals.
- It's why every chapter has a "Short Answer" section at the top. I try to get to the point for those who want! It's useful and desired!

Professional development are electives/continuing education for *professionals* (i.e. teachers, staff, etc.) and provided, typically, by people with active roles outside of education. Teachers/instructors usually need X number of hours to maintain a certificate, license, etc. PD is based around andragogy, adult learning, rather than pedagogy teachers may be used to, so you may experience a disconnect while attending them. Nevertheless, if you do go to a PD, be reasonably respectful to presenters and other attendees.

On one hand, some of these are extremely valuable to teachers and instructors. They could be designed by people with actual classroom experience, so they understand the context reasonably well. They also focus *on the content* and avoid unneccesary fluff.
- Sadly, in practice, these are the *exception.*

On the other hand, the PD sessions (not necessarily the presenters) are typically the bane of my existance for a variety of reasons:
- Not appropriately designed for the intended audience (adult professionals teaching other adult professionals).
- Not related to the grade level/audience a teacher manages.
- The veracity of information presented is inadequate.
- Presenter bias may overtake the course material intended for teachers.
- The PD elective may be a veiled attempt at marketing materials created by the presenter.
- A lack of proper research and evidence, which is the burden of the presenter(s), to support their material.
  - This includes research paid to support specific conclusions as well.
- It's a subject requiring a particular background, but the presenter isn't the appropriate background. (i.e. medical knowledge from a non-medical professional)
- The PD is ironically designed and undermines its own goals (E.g. a 8 hour presentation on condensing words and sentences)

My favorite PD days were typically:
- When I was allowed to choose which PD to pursue.
- Sessions covering my content area(s).
- An unofficial "do a quick, 15-minute report and check-up, then you can do your own work" day.
- The PD is showing a program, process, system, etc. to go over relatively quickly (e.g. 15 minutes in a 1 hour session), then the rest of the time was working with a team. Sometimes food was included.

In general, PD is good if it isn't a waste of time. Some people also use PD as a way to network with other professionals as well.
