# Teacher-Client Relations

### [Previous Chapter](Z012_Homework.html)

## **Short Answer**

Working with people outside of students, like parents and administrators, is also necessary. If you cannot do this well, you'll have a hard time making it through teaching and getting any support you need. If you treat your peers well, you'll (likely) get treated well in turn.

You'll also need to learn how to work with people you disagree with and not take things personally.

## **Long Answer**

***Disclaimer: This section is more heavily opinionated.***

### **Primer on Psychology (kind of)**

Before we go into how to deal with people, I should briefly talk about their goals and unconscious bias. If you know what someone's goal is, you'll have an easier time rationalizing and dealing with them. There are times goals vary among different people in the same position, so this is a comprehensive overview. As a teacher, you'll deal primarily with administrators and parents, as well as other teachers. Depending on your role or needs, you may also deal with agencies.

As for bias, it's unavoidable, ever-present, and unlikely to go away anytime soon. It's the things people don't *say* they do, but still do it anyway–the unknown knowns.

Here's an example: your gender affects people's expectations of you. They aren't *saying* it does, but it does. If you're a male, you're more likely to get away with doing the minimum/putting in less effort. Still, you also have more hard lines drawn with disciplining certain things, like dress code, which are more likely to be assigned to de-escalate situations, and are more restricted on what you can talk about in general. If you're a female, then you can comfort students without fear of retaliation more easily. Still, at the same time, you'll deal with students who have no trouble questioning your authority and all types of people judging you significantly more on your appearance.

Also, with gender, teachers and professors are not classified as a "bona fide occupational qualification" (BFOQ), so you legally cannot discriminate by gender for who gets into a teaching role in the United States (**[Further reading on BFOQ](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/cm-625-bona-fide-occupational-qualifications)**). This ruling may differ for other countries and sovereign states, however. Despite explicitly written laws with very narrow scopes, the bias still exists and permeates teaching culture extensively.

I could go on and on about more examples of biases students and non-students show towards teachers. Still, you're better off researching topics like "unconscious bias," "implicit bias," and "hidden bias" on your own time. In short, everyone has some level of unconscious bias, but the questions to answer are which biases they have, how they manifest, and how to deal with them.

### **Administrators**

We'll start with the principal, dean, and assistant principals, as they're your "boss." They want the school to perform well, and they are responsible for its success or failure. Think of these roles as C-Suite executive positions, such as CEO, CFO, and CTO. They oversee a company–the school, in this case–and report to a Board/Department of Education, who approve or denies actions principal(s) may push forward on. That same board also has a "vision" or standards they want the CEO/principal to execute for the good of the school, properly. 

In plain business terms, the Board/DoE wants a good return on the investment they put into the school. Ironically, the power a principal holds over teachers is limited by their hands being tied for many issues outside of their control, such as state and federal legal consequences for actions.

Unlike typical teaching (and designing) roles, principals and deans are more public-facing and deal with the brunt of *most* complaints and outside interference, such as the Department of Education, agencies, councils, parents, and more. They also deal with budgeting, meetings, staffing, planning, decision-making, operations, policy-making, public speaking, marketing, managing personnel (like teachers) across different disciplines, and significantly more. There's also much undefined work because these roles may need to do multiple duties outside of their work routine.

For smaller schools, you may need only a single principal, and sometimes the teachers will pitch in to cover deficiencies. For larger schools, you'll still have one "principal." Still, many roles are divided or partitioned out amongst multiple people, such as assistant principals or deans. These roles assume some duties similar to a principal, but specialize in specific duties (such as discipline), groups of students (such as finance major students), or specialized administrative tasks (such as Legal Counsel and HR Manager). The principal still has a hand in the affairs of everything at the school and has a surprisingly large amount of legal power.

As a teacher or instructor, your role is to produce the results the principal(s) need you to achieve with your students. Outside of that, when dealing with administrators as a teacher, you want to do the following:

- Communicate within the "chain-of-command" about issues. Sometimes you go straight to the principal, direct-to-head, and other times through an echelon below, like an assistant principal.
- Talk in a calm, polite, and respectful manner with them.
- If you need to "hold your ground" against them, expect to present evidence of why your stance is correct and consider what issues may occur with your stance.
    - There are times when you'll still lose holding your ground despite doing everything right. That's life.
- Keep written documentation of interactions with administration.
- Have them be aware of additional laws related to your subject, like with special education or gun safety, if relevant.
- Keep your opinion(s) to yourself unless asked for them or it's a significant issue affecting your teaching environment.
    - Remember: they have a lot to deal with already.
- If you come in with a problem, expect to come in with a potential solution too.
    - No one likes complainers, and administrators already deal with complainers.
- If you're unsure *why* a decision is made, stick with asking questions and clarification rather than forthright opinions.
- Keep your gradebook and lesson plans up to date.
- If you make their job easier, they will make your job easier.

Your best bet is to focus on becoming a more effective teacher, improving your curriculum, resolving issues independently, or improving professional relationships with students and staff.

### **Parents & Adult Students**

Imagine you own a business, but you're a teacher. Now imagine your "clients" are the parents of your students or, if old enough to be legally independent, the students themselves. Sometimes your administrator will support you in handling this category. Other times, they'll actively be against you. It depends on the administrator, and it's less something you can easily change.

The goal of parents is to ensure a good education, future opportunities, and a safe environment for learning for their children. A parent's logic is not necessarily standard logic; what seems sane to parents may not seem rational to non-parents.

For parents of students, you'll want to keep in mind the following:

- Keeping a paper trail of interactions whenever possible.
- Ensuring they are aware of policies of the school and your classes their children, as students, are in.
- Be ready to explicitly show them what is happening with their children in your classes, such as grades, disability accommodations, progress plans, and more.
- When meeting with them, consider having another teacher or administrator around as a witness to protect yourself.
- If there is a learning plan, such as IEP/504, to check if the parent is *also* fulfilling their duties as part of the plan, if the parent has any explicitly defined roles and duties.

For adult learners, you'll still want to treat them like students, but you've got a lot more leeway about what you can say and how you can teach. You aren't restricted any longer by "age-appropriate" content, but you still have "classroom-appropriate" content to deal with. Even though they are adult students, please do treat them like students and guests, not as your friends, while teaching. You can teach them as friends, sure, but you're in a position to *teach* them, not *befriend* them. Keep boundaries up during the teaching period still.

It also may help when students are adults, as they face significantly more legal repercussions if they cause issues. It's a forthright way of saying it helps classroom management without you doing any extra work.

With both groups of people, you'll want to set expectations from day one, if not even earlier than day one. It saves you time and also quickly establishes the environment they're dealing with.

### **Other Teachers**

You'll likely work with other teachers. If the school is small, you may be the only teacher present for a particular grade or field of expertise. Still, if the school is larger, you may be amongst other professionals in similar areas to what you're teaching, like multiple engineering professors in a single department.

In any of these cases, you'll find yourself working with teachers of varying skill levels, experience, and backgrounds. You can "talk shop" with them, going over curricula, figuring out if something works well here and can be applied there, or how one student is managing across classrooms.

Please do note, though, that much like other professional workers, they still need a space for breaks. Not every hour of every day requires you–or other staff–to talk to them about teaching. Talk about other things during downtime, like outside life, sports, etc.

With more sensitive topics like religion and politics, avoid talking about those still unless you're sure the other teachers you're around are OK with civilly discussing these topics.

### **Secondary & Primary Education Students**

**Why do students fall under clients? It's because they're the ones receiving your services–what you're teaching them!** This category is for students still considered minors. The biggest thing to note is that minors don't follow the (exact) same rules as adults when it comes to learning, and it's in their name: they are *not* adults. Sometimes, younger students genuinely do not know any better because they haven't been *taught* any better; you're often working with a (mostly) blank canvas.

For students in general, you want to go in with as few assumptions as possible; the fewer, the better. Here are some assumptions you can safely make about students, but also be ready to change them if needed:

- The students you're teaching do not know the material you're teaching extensively.
- What seems easy to you may be complicated for them
- May not be as motivated to learn or put in the work as you are to teach
- There are emotions and feelings that a student may not be able to express well
- They may not be familiar with the same tools you are familiar with (like computers)
- They may not follow your instructions well and/or correctly the first time
- They may lack basic skills

These assumptions focus on what you may experience as a student goes into your classroom for the first time. It isn't prudent to make bad assumptions about students in general, as it'll heavily affect how you approach teaching and rapport. Still, you'll likely form an established opinion about the student(s) later on based on their *actions done* and *words said* during class.

With assumptions out of the way, think of students as clients you're trying to sell your material to. This is where storytelling comes in and captivates an audience to engage with your material. If they don't find it engaging, then they will not engage. You could hold the threat of a grade over them, which can work sometimes, but not always.

They'll be interested in fun activities precisely because they *are* fun, but may avoid activities that are not fun. Older students may view unfun activities more negatively, but objectively, in terms of payoff vs time and effort put in. These students lose motivation due to the reward structure and how the class is structured, more so than anything you say as a teacher.

One strategy I've used, to some success, is explicitly asking the students what kind of activities they want to learn and do. Their choice(s) are the units and information I must cover per my standards. Still, this method ensures they have a way to "buy in" or invest their time into what I'm teaching. For already motivated students, this won't do much. For students on the fence or less motivated, it serves as a tipping point to raise motivation and make them feel like they have a stake in what they want to learn, which is something you can provide them.

Lastly, keep in mind students of all ages are still *students.* They are not your friends. You can interact with them in a friendly manner, but you are ultimately there to teach them. It's the same in business outside of teaching; you may be good friends with a supplier, but there's still some expectation of reward or money you give them rather than only altruistic feelings amongst informal friend groups. You'll need to set expectations and establish clear boundaries, and enforce any punishments fairly that follow for breaking those expectations.

### **Support Staff**

Last, but certainly not least, are your fellow support staff. These are people who work in the same environment, school, etc. as you, but aren't necessarily your manager/boss or a teacher like yourself. Support includes secretaries, custodians, maintenance staff, paras, security, nurses, cafeteria staff, groundskeepers, and more.

Without these staff members, your school wouldn't be able to keep rooms clean, take care of the learning environment, and maintain a safe and orderly environment. It would force you into taking on more administrative tasks as well. In short, **they help *you* do *your* job–albeit indirectly.**

To keep it simple, treat them well. If you don't, you'll find yourself saddled with bad conditions and more work very quickly.

### **Handling [Adult] Communications and Urgency**

How do you know when something is important? I have some indicators:

1. It has a deadline.
2. It has consequences if not done (defined elsewhere or explicitly in a communication).
3. It can be verified whether or not *you* did it.
4. It has specific information (this part can be short or long).
5. It's been asked about more than once.
6. It's *probably* not sent as an email/text message.
7. It's a life-threatening and/or medical emergency.

Your first year of working, you're likely not going to "know" if something is important, so go through the process of responding as usual and figure out what things are actually important. Even in my first year of teaching, I didn't "figure it out" until at least several months in. I don't expect you to be perfect from day one. 

When you develop an intuition for it, you'll learn to better protect your time and what to prioritize.

Next question: How often should you check things like your email every day?

If you're in a line of work like communication, social media, owning a business, or a manager, this is pretty often. If your primary work is NOT communicating, then you should plan out specific times of the day to look at emails, etc. and what days, like vacation days and weekends, to NOT look at emails, etc.

There's also some "rules of thumb" to emails/texts I like to follow:
- Writing them as short as possible
- Unless they're actually important, they're responded to during work hours.
- Some personalization in 1:1 emails
  - E.g. "This student said they" -> "[Name of student] mentioned [pronoun]..."
- If it avoids a 1 hour meeting, I'm making a 5 minute email
- [If the sender does this, I'm ignoring it](https://nohello.net/en/)

There's plenty of nuance in adult communication you'll develop experience for over time, which is why covering every case is both unreasonable and nigh impossible for me to do.
