# 1. A Manager TL;DR

## **My Role Overview**

- **Duration:** 2 years
- **Role:** Teacher (In-Person, NOT Online)
- **School Types:** Secondary and Primary Education; public & private schools

## **Results**

Designed multiple full-year science curricula in my first year of teaching. Achieved this with strong time management during contract hours, which resulted in high student performance across all classes.

## **2 Years of Teaching in <2 Minutes**

Due to a teaching contract, I cannot easily provide curriculum materials as I *technically* don't own them; the school/district does. All examples and information are HIPAA/FERPA compliant.

- **Your overall mission is turning complex subjects into simple(r) lessons.**
- Teaching is many different fields merged in a single profession.
    - You are, however, NOT a therapist.
- What you legally follow depends on your location, subject, and place of employment.
- Plan and prepare for the worst, but assume the best of students.
- Plan a class as if there's only one teacher in the room for all students.
- What you need to do depends heavily on what, where, and how you're teaching.
    - Sometimes you need to make concessions on material covered and edit curriculum materials to fit standards.
- You may need a license or certification to teach specific subjects or do certain tasks legally, such as administering medicine to students.
- Even if you're the leading expert in your subject, you won't know *everything* and you should expect to use external sources to supplement teaching.
- Every student wants to be understood and accepted.
- Compromises are easy solutions, but not always the best or morally correct solution.
- You can block many topics into short, fixed-time periods of 1, 2, or 4 weeks and include a balance of lectures, activities, projects, and tests.
- Be ready and able to adjust lesson plans as needed, even on a day-by-day basis.
- *Every* subject requires teachers to communicate well through storytelling. If you cannot communicate well, then you cannot get students to invest in learning.
- If it works as a summary, use a summary.
- Good lectures are not boring. Bad lectures are boring.
- The best way to learn varies across topics, and you can teach multiple ways at once.
- The time spent in class should make up for the time spent on homework, and it also depends heavily on the subject. More time in class = less time on homework.
- Collaborating with people outside of students, like parents and administrators, is necessary. If you cannot do this well, you'll have a hard time as a teacher.
- If you treat your peers well, you'll (likely) get treated well in turn.
- You'll need to learn how to work with people you disagree with and learn how not to take things personally.
- Don't use AI for learning if students do not know how to use AI safely and properly.
- Money is always a constraint when teaching. Be careful about how you spend it.
- Templates are king, so learn to design reusable materials.

# 2. The Actual Overview

## **My Role & Time**

- Duration: 2 years
- Role: Teacher (In-Person, NOT Online)
- School Types: Secondary and Primary Education; public & private schools

## **Introduction**

Imagine I need to get a new teacher, instructor, presenter, etc. from 0-100 as fast as possible, without giving them any additional materials to copy and paste. They're in a situation where they start from, well, basically nothing.

**That's my problem here to solve, and this writing is my solution. I take what seems complex and simplify it to make it more accessible.**

Think of this writing as the starting point. If you need to learn or expand on a topic, you'll have an idea *which* topic to further learn about rather than be completely aimless.

A teacher exists in many different forms. There's the formal teacher many students are familiar with, but there are also teachers in unexpected places. Perhaps you've shown someone how to ride a bicycle, operate a piece of software, or help interpret a book passage. All those, and countless other examples, are taught by you.

Because a teacher exists in many different forms, they can come from many backgrounds. A data engineer may create a guide discussing ETL and data cleaning, a designer may touch upon Gestalt Principles and accessibility, and an architect may explain to their friends why they use a 2x6 wall over a 2x4 wall on bathroom walls where the shower line is installed (hint: it's easy for plumbing and weather-proofing).

Everyone can teach. You may not need to condense an entire PhD and graduate thesis into two sentences to explain a topic. Still, if you can communicate a topic you know to another person, and they can understand it, you're capable of teaching someone.

### **Audience**

This book caters to the following people in mind:

- Teachers starting out
- People in instructional roles (formally or not) with no idea where to start
- Teachers with limited time (<2 weeks) to set up an entire new course to teach (my case)
- People teaching online and/or outside of traditional classroom settings
- People teaching in traditional classroom settings
- People with non-teaching backgrounds and multi-disciplinary backgrounds
- A student wondering why their teacher is doing things a certain way
- Hiring managers do not want to read the entire thing and get an overview

### **Assumptions / Advisory for Readers**

- Some statements and information may not be independently verifiable because they rely on internal evidence like grades, timelines, surveys, and more. Some info I cannot openly share legally, and other information I purposely omit PID/PII.
- **You are hired on as a teacher, able to be hired into an instructional role (not necessarily a "Teacher" title), OR you are in a role where you design learning materials and curricula in general.**
    - **This means I'm not covering how to get a teaching license–or other licenses–extensively as it's a varied, case-by-case basis.**
    - You could also be a reader outside of these cases, which is totally fine.
- The frameworks and advice I give are initially designed for technical classes, such as math, engineering, and science.
    - If able, I'll call out potential adjustments for other subject areas.
- You are dealing with reasonable students.
    - This is purposely vague and depends on the type of group taught.
    - Think of "normal expectations" for your area, industry, behaviors, etc.
- Students are capable of performing work when given by a teacher.
- Up to moderate disabilities are present in some, but not the majority, of students.
- The reader does not require a special background or expertise to implement the advice and strategies discussed here.
- Many "results" I talk about are from direct observations over the years I've taught and are difficult to quantify outside of estimations when you're doing multiple tasks at once and cannot treat the classroom like a user research session.
    - Additionally, using data from my students may introduce two types of bias from non-probability sampling: voluntary response and convenience.
- For any products I call out and examples from those products, I am not endorsing or saying you need to purchase/use those products. They are there because I used them and thought they had value to me when I taught.

# 3. Legality

## **Short Answer**

What you legally follow depends on your location, subject, and place of employment.

Undergraduate and graduate education, such as colleges, universities, and post-graduate programs–as well as secondary education with college courses–has some different rules to follow compared to primary and secondary education.

*Notice: The following information above and below is NOT legal advice.*

## **Long Answer**

Think of legality as a way to protect your students and you. Yes, *you* need legal protection as a teacher. What is legal and not legal dictates whether or not you can teach what you're teaching.

First, the obvious. What is a law is still a law you should–and need to–follow in the classroom.

As for the less obvious, you'll need to search for it. I'm most familiar with the State of Colorado in the United States, so my examples are from there. If you're elsewhere in the United States, the exact organizations will differ, but still serve similar roles. Suppose you're outside of the United States. In that case, you may have something like the Department of Education and other federal judiciary organizations for your sovereign state.

Using the State of Colorado as an example, I had some level of interaction with these types of organizations and laws. I don't expect to list or remember every organization, act, and law here; only a sample.

- Colorado Department of Education (CDE)
- U.S. Department of Education
- U.S. Federal Court and Copyright Office
- District Office (Traditional Classrooms)
- School Boards (Traditional Classrooms)
- American Council on Education (ACE)
- Software Organizations and Service Agencies
- HIPAA/FERPA
- Fair and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)
- Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
- Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)
- General Educational Development (GED)
- Department of Public Safety (Mandatory Reporting)
- Child Protective Services (CPS)
- U.S. Department of Justice
- International Baccalaureate (IB)
- ACT
- College Board (SAT, AP, etc.)

For high schools with specialized tracks, colleges, and universities, your list may include, but is not limited to, accreditations necessary for licensing and job requirements, such as:

- Higher Learning Commission (HLC)
- Western Association of Schools and Colleges Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC)
- Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)
- Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)
- National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB)

Education is a responsibility of the state, including its public and private organizations, to establish, fund, and maintain schools and teaching. "State" means states like New York, Kansas, and Colorado, not the United States as a country.

Of the organizations listed earlier, the CDE deals with Colorado education the most, from my personal experience. District offices and school boards are tied primarily to private schools, public schools, and colleges. The CDE covers all of those organizations and other areas, such as homeschooling, student protection, mental health education, and state assessments, among others. They also issue licenses and set the standards teachers must meet to maintain their certification. Additionally, they establish the standards that teachers follow in their curricula.

Traditional teachers also deal with the District Office and the School Boards, as those entities expand upon the standards set by them for teachers. For example, a District may decide what textbooks or expanded curriculum to implement, as well as approve which software may accommodate subjects like science, literature, reading, writing, mathematics, and history.

Private schools have separate clauses and statutes that they follow compared to public schools, allowing private schools more freedom for internal affairs and their curriculum and teaching methods. The CDE neither endorses nor accredits private schools, which means some avenues for funding and public support programs are unavailable.

Some online public schools and programs are overseen, supported, and endorsed by CDE. They may also include in-person activities with other students in those programs, where a student is online for 80% of traditional school hours.

Unofficial and licensed teachers and instructors may also utilize and create content on platforms like YouTube, Udemy, and Coursera. These platforms are most likely to deal with the U.S. Federal Court and Copyright Office, as primary issues there are DMCA, Fair Use, copyrighting, and more. For these platforms, it can be as simple as making a video or presentation on a topic you're passionate about and want to share with others. Rather than traditional educational bodies, you'll deal primarily with the rules (and monetization requirements) of your hosting platforms, like YouTube or Udemy, as well as U.S. Federal Courts and the Copyright Office to protect any content you or other creators made.

There are some online courses separate from educational institutions that count towards college credits, such as IBM Professional Certificates endorsed by the American Council of Education (ACE), but where they count towards credit varies significantly and is outside the scope of this discussion. Nevertheless, be aware that they do exist.

### **Student Protection Laws**

*Notice: This is for the United States only. Other nations I'm unaware of, and I won't speak on.*

Generally speaking, students, teachers, and teaching staff will deal with FERPA and HIPAA. FERPA and HIPAA are safeguards for people's personal information, such as address, first and last name, gender, and other personal identifiers (PIDs). You cannot share this information outside of appropriate parties, such as other teachers in your school, law enforcement, public health, EMTs, and the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the student you talk about. Also, it's safe to assume speaking to another professional with your same role/title, but where each party is in different organizations, about this information may also violate FERPA/HIPAA.

For more information on FERPA and HIPAA, see the following links below:

- [https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/index.html)  
- [https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/ferpa-hipaa/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/ferpa-hipaa/index.html)  
- [https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/ferpa-and-hipaa/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/ferpa-and-hipaa/index.html)

The FERPA and HIPAA relationship stems from the fact that educational records covered under FERPA are excluded from HIPAA. They both have their own set of regulations when it comes to disclosing health information as well. In addition to personal information coverage, FERPA also covers educational records.

In a teaching position, expect to follow FERPA guidelines more than HIPAA guidelines.

### **Student Disabilities and Accommodations**

For students with disabilities, as a teacher, you'll be expected to adjust your lesson plans and curriculum to meet their needs. Sometimes this is easy to do, such as making an electronic version of an assignment instead of a physical one. Sometimes this is extremely difficult, but legally necessary, to accommodate, such as planning for medical emergencies.

In the United States, the most common accommodations I've personally seen are Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), Section 504 Plans (504s), and Individualized Health Plans (IHPs). Sometimes there are Behavior Intervention Plans or Behavior Support Plans (BIPs and BSPs). Still, they're less common based on anecdotal evidence. Each plan addresses physical, mental, medical, cognitive abilities, education, and learning ability.

An IEP/504 is also a legally binding document. It shows every party has entered into it willingly and provided their signatures as verification. Every party involved, including the student (if applicable), teachers, parents, and administrators, must follow the plan, or they may suffer legal consequences for non-compliance.

To summarize, an IEP focuses on modifying the instruction/delivery of material and establishes specialized goals and milestones. In contrast, a 504 focuses on changing the environment in which learning occurs (e.g., seating arrangement, extra test time, etc.). An IHP is independent of these two and focuses on special medical conditions and what can be reasonably changed to meet those.

IEPs and 504s have nationwide resources available, whereas IHPs have info at the state level. Here are a few links for future reference.

- [https://sites.ed.gov/idea/topic-areas/#IEP](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/topic-areas/#IEP)  
- [https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/individuals-disabilities/section-504](https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/individuals-disabilities/section-504)  
- [https://www.cde.state.co.us/shs/individualizedhealthcareplanprocesspdfjune2019](https://www.cde.state.co.us/shs/individualizedhealthcareplanprocesspdfjune2019)

Establishing one of these plans is not always your responsibility as a teacher, but meeting the plan's accommodations and understanding a student's specific needs are a teacher's responsibility. Additionally, these plans can change over time and are not immutable for the entire student's learning journey.

### **Mandatory Reporting**

If you're a teacher or professor, you're also a mandatory reporter. Mandatory reporters are LEGALLY REQUIRED (I cannot stress this enough) to look out for signs of child abuse and neglect and contact the appropriate hotline. The exact contact varies from State to State, as laws for handling this are decided mainly by the state. Still, every state follows similar mandatory reporter laws. It requires you to ensure, with certainty, that a report goes to the local Department of Human Services, Child Welfare Division.

**As a caution:** If you fail to report, you may face fines and imprisonment. In some states, you can face felonies for not reporting. In the same breath, however, you can face either a misdemeanor or a felony for intentionally sending in a false report, depending on the state you're in.

You are both required to report signs and report them *knowing beyond a reasonable doubt* that abuse or neglect is happening. This requirement also applies if you *suspect* child abuse too. For your safety, an investigation into a reported fall is handled by CPS and law enforcement.

### **Teaching/Instructional Contracts**

If you're a teacher or instructor, it's likely you also signed a contract. The particulars vary widely from place to place, so I'll say just this:

- Read every line of fine print in your contract.
- You are also allowed to ask the administration drafting the contract about specific clauses, but do it with grace.

More importantly, the contract may explicitly spell out who owns whatever property or material you make. In many cases, materials you make for teaching or utilize may belong to the establishment, district, or school and not to you. In rarer cases, you may be safe to use materials you make at one location and use, distribute, or teach at another location without much issue.

**The point is:**

- **Read. Contracts. Carefully.**
- If there's something in a contract you don't know about, fix that ASAP.

# 4. Management 101

## **Short Answer**

**Prepare for the worst, but assume the best of students.** You may also need licensure or certifications to teach specific subjects or do particular tasks legally, such as administering medicine to students

- Also, never be alone with two or fewer students in a room without the door open.

## **Long Answer**

Teaching is either extremely hands-off (many online "courses" avoid interfacing with students almost entirely) or extremely hands-on.

Students range from a variety of backgrounds across multiple demographics. What may work for one student may not work for another, and how a student behaves in class varies from student to student. Some students may also respect the authority of a teacher and be respectful to other students. Some students will actively undermine the education of their peers, interrupt you when an opportunity arises, or even resort to physical contact.

This is a reality of the environment many teachers and instructors deal with on a daily, if not hourly, basis in a classroom setting.

**You still need to plan for the worst-case scenarios.**

If you can figure out how to handle students at their worst, then you can handle them at every other degree of behavior.

### **Everyday Classroom Management Rules**

There are rules you need to follow with every management style:

- **It must be legal for you to do.**
- No means no. If you do not allow something, you MUST be willing and able to enforce that. The moment you do not, it becomes a rule that students, adults, and minors know can be broken.
- Appropriate punishments for appropriate behaviors. A student talking out of turn can be resolved with a warning. That same student actively bullying another cannot be solved the same way and requires escalation.
- Ignore any attention-seeking behavior, as not every quip or comment a student makes is worth your time or even a reply.
- A management style you're comfortable with is a management style you'll enforce and follow more easily.
- Determine where "the line" is and do not move it unless necessary. Regardless of age, if someone can get away with something, they will try to do it.
- People listen to the advice of someone who knows what they're talking about more readily than someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. If you lose the perception that you understand what you're talking about, you also lose respect and weaken the ability to teach properly to students (or a group/audience in general).

### **Enforcing Control**

Success varies greatly depending on what type of group you're teaching. Still, some strategies are universal and applicable at various degrees of success with groups.

One single list will not solve all your problems. You'll need to adjust strategies over time, and this is something you have to do in practice rather than just reading about it. Other times, you don't have time to review the entire list mentally and may have less than a few seconds to get back control before chaos occurs.

**Here are some examples to enforce control of the room:**

- Establish a routine. If students know what to do without constant reminders, they're less likely to go out of turn.
- Clearly define the rules. Explicitly stated rules are followed and enforced better than implied rules.
- Shouting matches don't work. The first one to shout loses, so don't be the first one to shout.
- Remain calm.
- Determine where "the line" is and do not move it unless necessary.
- Do not carelessly give away rewards for good behavior, as they can be detrimental to intrinsic motivation by replacing it with extrinsic motivation.
- Be prepared to have a reason for why something is done the way it is. If it's because "you said so," it's not something you should do.
- Even if restricted by what you may teach, getting students to choose what they want to learn may increase their desire to learn and motivation to do well. (similar topic: "stakeholder buy-in")
- Calling out a student directly is more effective than simply stating "stop causing trouble" without calling out the person causing the trouble.
- Use statements over orders. Short and precise is best. "Fix it, please." "Do [thing], please."
    - If a statement is over 10 seconds long, it's too long. You can shorten it.
- Establish ways to set rapport. You don't need to be–or should be–their friends, but you do need to earn their respect.
- Be ready to "pull the trigger" when disciplining.
- Decide where and how you want people to sit, stand, or otherwise in a classroom, whether by strict assignment or casually (i.e., "just sit in a chair")
    - For online teaching, decide what they need to set up on their computer, phone, etc. to receive information and do tasks you assign appropriately.
- **Regulate the use of AI by students when possible (more on that later).**

### **Attention Economy**

The amount of time a student can focus depends on many factors, such as age, disposition, and personality. 

Generally speaking, the younger students are, the less time they can maintain focus before needing a break. A common rule of thumb is that a younger student's *maximum* attention span is 2 to 3 times their age (e.g., 13 years old = 26-39 minutes) before a short break is needed. The [**Pomodoro technique**](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) is one example of a management method capitalizing on attention spans.

Since 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a proliferation of short-form content, like TikTok videos and YouTube shorts. Due to their implementation of highly optimized psychological techniques to get your time, which are also found in similar apps and software, maintaining focus in a classroom is set to Hard mode by default. It's not impossible, but you're starting at a hefty disadvantage. Rather than demonizing this software, it may help you, as a teacher, to figure out *why* these methods grab attention so effectively and see if you can use that in teaching.

If a student wants to learn something, they'll at least try to learn something–which may not be what you're teaching. It's not always the case of the student intentionally doing something bad. Still, something else caught their attention more at the time, or they got confused about something and are now acting out.

**Fighting for attention can be remedied with some of these techniques.** They may not work perfectly and their effects vary, but it's significantly better than *not* using any of them.

- Keep an overall level of focus (look up "utilization rate") at 85% to 90%.
    - Some mental wandering, breaks, and loss of focus among students should be expected and accounted for.
    - Multiple study techniques are designed with breaks, so learning and teaching techniques should incorporate breaks too.
- Do not carelessly give away rewards for good behavior, as they can be detrimental to intrinsic motivation by replacing it with extrinsic motivation.
    - This means less interest in whatever you're trying to teach, as their goal is now the reward and not the knowledge you're imparting.
- Plan for potential breaks during classroom sessions.
    - For example, a 45-minute lecture can turn into 2, 20-minute parts with a few minutes break midway for a significant boost in retention, attention, and learning.
    - Just because a student *can* maintain focus for 50 minutes doesn't necessarily mean they always *should* do that every class.
- Get creative and use visuals to supplement material you're trying to teach.
    - Images tend to be far more pleasant to look at than large bodies of text. They are easier to digest information from when appropriately created.
- For presentations and lectures taught with a presentation screen of some sort, limit it to <= 50 words on a screen at a time.
    - **If you have to present more than that amount of words at once, prepare a means to highlight, underline, or accentuate parts you want to call attention to.**

### **Positive and Negative Student Behaviors**

*This usually applies to younger students, but older and adult learners can have behavior issues too.* 

Two categories I'll put behaviors in are positive and negative.

Every student wants to be understood and accepted, but each student has different ways of getting that acknowledgement. Negative behaviors can be replacements for a lack of attention or acknowledgement for many people.

Positive behaviors are behaviors you want to enforce and reward, such as giving attention to, providing *random* acknowledgements, and compliments. These behaviors vary across teachers, but generally, they are things you want students to do and how you want them to act. For behaviors you want to see, you provide a clear path to reach them and indications that they are reaching positive behaviors along the way to the goal.

Negative behaviors are behaviors that put you, the classroom, or other students at a disadvantage and threaten the sanctity of the learning environment. Whenever a negative-attention-seeking behavior occurs from a student, I prefer two ways to handle it.

1. Shut it down immediately.
    1. All it takes is a few seconds for control to be lost, your authority diminished, and the rest of the class/audience to see an opportunity to make it worse.
2. Ignore it entirely.
    1. This doesn't mean being harsh, but ignoring them means figuring out later how to replace negative behaviors with positive behaviors.

I'll talk more about these when I reach learning methodologies, but these negative behaviors require stern management. Negative behaviors tend to have these traits in common:

- Acquiring social attention
- May start mild and innocent, but devolve into something worse
- A reason behind the negative behavior

If a student shows signs of one of the following, or something related, do not feed into the attention they're seeking, or it will spiral out of control:

- Overly dramatic reactions
- Dramatic or provocative behavior
- Fishing for compliments
- Excessive noise-making
- Pushing boundaries
- Bullying others in the classroom
- Talking out of turn

Even if you mitigate negative behaviors, it doesn't always mean they're gone entirely. There is a reason behind the negative behavior. It is up to you to figure it out, or else the negative behavior will repeat. These negative behaviors also occur outside of a school setting and aren't limited to students; your fellow staff, other adults, and children may also show them.

Negative behaviors will rarely resolve in a single day as well. They can take a week, a month, or even years to fix–or at least get better compared to before. Controlling behaviors amongst students is an exercise in management you cannot avoid, nor should you avoid.

Additionally, if you're a teacher, there are specific actions that only other staff, such as principals and security, are equipped to handle and legally allowed to hold. If it reaches that point, do not hesitate to contact one of them to try to get the situation under control. The longer it takes to control the problem, the more likely something bad will happen.

**Remember: All it takes is one disruptive, mismanaged student to ruin a classroom.**

### **Employing Negotiation Tactics**

Though it's a bit extreme of an application, you can utilize hostage negotiation strategies in a classroom setting. Don't do this everywhere, though; there's a time and place for negotiations. One book I've read, if you're curious about these strategies, is called *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss. There are many different things you can take from negotiation tactics, but I'll focus on a few key aspects below.

**A win-win strategy–or a compromise–isn't always the ideal outcome, nor is it always a moral good to compromise for the best outcome.** Compromises are easy to do and *seem* fair, which is why compromising is often the first thing people employ when negotiating. Better solutions require creativity and have a higher payout for all sides. Still, they undergo a heavier risk and potential conflict as a barrier to reaching those solutions. A significant risk involved in compromises is that you're often assuming, as a teacher, that a student is thinking like you. That *isn't* empathy; you're not understanding their point of view. Instead, you're projecting your perspective(s) onto them and making a potentially dangerous assumption, which can escalate the situation in neither party's favor.

Students are more comfortable around rules and situations where it is "fair" to them. If something *seems* unfair, that's another avenue for students to add to their negative behaviors and cause issues in the classroom. From personal experience, students seem to react more when something is about to be taken away, or given a "No," rather than receiving something or getting a "Yes," even though they are the ones causing the loss to themselves.

It's essential to exercise self-control in negotiation and defusing situations. Unless you have self-control and can regulate emotions, you won't regain control, and negative behaviors will affect the student, causing them to spread to other students. Control also includes your tone of voice, body language, and facial expressions. About 90% of your communication–and the communication of different students–is reflected in non-verbal components instead of the actual words you're saying.

Delving into this area further brings you into the world of psychology and subjects such as calibrated questions, leverage, empathy, negotiation, deflections, and more. Keep in mind that while negotiation and manipulation seem similar and have a shared goal, the methodology used to reach that goal is vastly different. Negotiation seeks mutual benefits and understanding amongst all parties. In contrast, manipulation seeks control and tricks for one party to get what they want. Negotiation helps people, and manipulation harms people.

### **Automating your Workload**

The general rule of thumb is that if something *can* be automated, you should automate it. Why spend hours grading multiple-choice questions by hand when you can instantly grade them in a fraction of the time by supplying an answer key and putting it through software, or even hosting the assignment on a platform like Google Forms?

However, you also want to make sure you don't automate yourself out of a job. You'd probably still want to get paid.

**Remember: Time is your most valuable resource. Once gone, it cannot be restored.**
- **Also remember: automation can be expensive and may not always solve EVERY problem.**

As a teacher, whatever you do should be optimized to free up more time. The more time you have, the more time you can dedicate to your other students–or matters outside of teaching.

Automation–and AI (Artificial Intelligence) by extension–is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Not everything can–and should–be automated. If you're unsure of what existing technology can automate, I'll provide examples below:

- Grading questions with discrete, well-defined, and objective answers, like the results of math equations
- Progress report submission and filling
- Sending multiple emails at once
- Tasks with repetition
- Formatting of documents
- Generating ideas and prompts
- Shortening text and summarizing

# 5. Standards / Objectives

## **Short Answer**

Standards depend heavily on what, where, and how you're teaching. You may have many standards to follow or not that many, so learn where you can and cannot be flexible on topics to enhance learning. Additionally, you may have to make concessions on issues and the time you need for the curriculum.

- **Your main goal here is to meet all standards and go into the appropriate depth on each relevant topic.**

## **Long Answer**

**Warning: Do not skimp or mess around with standards and objectives.**

There are several reasons why:

- You'll find it hard to create a curriculum without establishing them
- Some materials you want to use for teaching may not align with the standards
- In the worst case, standards not appropriately covered and taught may put you and others in legal and financial trouble

**Once you firmly establish your standards and objectives, *then* you can be creative in your teaching methodology.** Objectives and standards need to be ironclad or else the floor you're building your curriculum on falls through and collapses. Another way to think about standards and objectives is the guardrails for your curriculum; they mitigate you from going overboard or focusing too heavily in one area when you need to spread focus across multiple regions. In business terms, it limits your scope.

Though standards and objectives limit what you should do, good objectives and standards will elevate your teaching ability, provide clear direction, and include explicitly written measures to evaluate how you're teaching and if you're covering what you need to.

Depending on where and what you're teaching, you might skip most of the curriculum setup and have it dictated by your State and/or District. Other times, you may receive a list of standards to meet and create your curriculum.

If you're doing an independent series outside of an academic institution, such as teaching people how to cook your homemade pasta on YouTube or a list of recipes and kitchen tools, expect to do most, if not all, of the setup for what to teach and how.

If, however, you're teaching in a physical environment like a traditional classroom, the answer is *it depends*. Some schools and districts provide a plethora of curriculum materials or even a pre-packaged curriculum from start to finish. In contrast, others do not, and it's up to teachers to create a curriculum. In both cases, as well as homeschooling, you're still constrained by your State's Department of Education standards and objectives.

If you're unsure how to find state education standards, the best place to start is the Internet. For example, I'll use Colorado's website and search for K-12 academic standards.

1. Go to your State's DoE website (Colorado = CDE)
    1. E.g. [https://www.cde.state.co.us/](https://www.cde.state.co.us/)  
2. Search for "Academic Standards"
3. Assuming the website is indexed properly, it should be the first result or on the first result page 
    1. E.g. [https://www.cde.state.co.us/standardsandinstruction/standards](https://www.cde.state.co.us/standardsandinstruction/standards)  
4. From there, you can select a subject area or look through all standards in one menu 
    1. E.g. [https://www.cde.state.co.us/apps/standards/](https://www.cde.state.co.us/apps/standards/)
    2. You can also sort by focus and grade level.

For colleges and universities, a similar search process may occur in your specialized or institutional accreditation, providing standards you need to follow.

From there, you may find various items, such as grade-level expectations (GLEs), evidence outcomes, connections and contexts, concepts, as well as elaborations.

You may come across other sets of standards (NOT curricula!) such as NGSS and Common Core as well. These are efforts made by multiple states across the United States, rather than a single state or the nation's Department of Education alone. They also include advisory and collaboration with outside organizations, such as the National Research Council. Initiatives like these may also receive federal grants, but it is not always the case. One important note is that individual states may also partially adopt, rather than deny or accept fully, standards made through these efforts.

**Before we end, let me re-emphasize two critical points:**

- States and Districts require teachers to cover the appropriate standards. Still, despite doing everything correctly, there are times you need to shorten or summarize teaching specific standards. That's not always a failure on your part; that's just life as a teacher.
- A set of standards can be good, but a curriculum using those standards can be poor. The inverse is also true, but significantly more challenging to achieve.

# 6. Roadblocks To Teaching

## **Short Answer**

**There are four types of blockers I'll define:**

- Technical
- Physical
- Monetary
- Interpersonal

These blockers depend heavily on whether you're in a physical classroom, online, etc., as well as what equipment you have, what you can afford, and the disposition of the students you teach.

## **Long Answer**

In a teaching environment, you'll experience several types of blockers I'll address below. Some blockers are within your control and manageable, while others are outside of your control and either restrict access entirely or require circumnavigating around to reach your intended goal(s).

For simplicity's sake, I'll sort blockers into four categories.

### **Technical Blockers**

In one sentence, is there a device that cannot operate the software and/or perform the tasks I need for teaching?

*If no, proceed with whatever plans you have; you're good.*

*If yes, it's a blocker and you either:*

- Cannot use it
- Need to find an alternative with lower technical requirements

For example, you can showcase Crysis on a Chromebook, but the computer doesn't have the specifications to handle it. Instead, show you can run Doom on a Chromebook, and it solves a similar problem with a more efficient (and probably free) solution.

Another example is you want students to use school-provided equipment to operate a flight simulator. Still, you discover, probably through "dxdiag" on a Windows computer, that the specifications are nowhere near good enough. That's OK, though, because there are less resource-intensive browser alternatives.

**Be warned, though:** using alternative software may not meet all of your needs or accurately do what is needed to meet your objectives. As long as Plan B works and meets your needs, it's good enough. You can always supplement other materials related to the subject(s) to fill in gaps.

The only time you are *stuck* with teaching a given software is if you're trying to get students to earn a certification or licensure with it. You definitely cannot use alternatives with those; you must use the required software or they cannot get the certification or license. Some software also requires the teacher to hold a license or certificate to legally teach the software and/or administer tests to earn the licenses and certifications, so you'll need to double-check that first.

### **Physical Blockers**

These blockers refer to the space you're teaching in or from. They can also refer to the physical limits of what humans can and cannot do.

You may need a specific type of room or equipment. Still, the area you are in cannot support it, or it does not have the proper connections, such as natural gas pipes, ample space, or high voltage outlets, to support your teaching equipment.

Some physical blockers you can easily deal with, such as moving around desks and chairs in a room. Other physical blockers are significantly harder or costly to deal with, such as installing new windows or installing a new engineered wood raised platform in the middle of a room.

With a bit of creativity and ingenuity, physical blockers are not as restrictive as other types. Still, they influence how students act and pay attention. You could teach an entire classroom with everyone standing, but then taking notes, drawing, or writing is significantly impaired. You could also place people across the room in rows, clusters, etc., to influence how they interact with each other and you.

A rarer example of a physical blocker is if you have students with disabilities. The area is grandfathered in through building codes, which means no ADA-compliant ramps or access, meaning that a student cannot enter your classroom by themselves. You could consider:

- Provide assistance to get them into the classroom, whether by yourself (very legally risky) or request other students to help (less legally risky)
- Hosting the classroom in a different location to solve physical restriction issues
- Provide alternative forms of learning and accommodations to solve learning issues

For the example above, I would consider whether it is possible to assist in the room through another student, followed by alternative learning forms. The other solutions are either legally complicated or unable to occur due to numerous obstacles like space, money, etc.

There are countless more cases of physical blockers. Still, your overall goal with any space is this: Rearrange the physical space to deliver best the material and expertise you want to teach.

For online spaces, the goal is similar, but add guardrails and ways to stay focused on you, the teacher, to prevent people from straying from the material you're actively teaching.

### **Monetary Blockers**

You can accomplish a lot with sufficient funding. More often than not, however, you don't have the appropriate funds.

When funding is limited, be ready to resort to low-cost or free alternatives, or omit types of learning that require online or physical payments. Fortunately, thanks to advancing technology, you can do most things at a low price now, if not entirely free, through software like Notion, Google Documents, Google Sheets, DBeaver, pgAdmin, and Visual Studio. Some planning software for teacher use, like Planbook, is also low-cost or free.

There are multiple types of websites–government, commercial, non-profit, and personal–with free simulations and interactive software available for student and public use, such as [**NASA's Eyes**](https://science.nasa.gov/eyes/) for solar systems and [**USGS TopoView**](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/) for topographic map viewing and manipulation.

With some software, though, such as ArcGIS, Revit, and SolidWorks, you may need to purchase Educational and Student Licenses. These are *not* cheap, but typically more affordable when bought for educational and student use compared to business, personal, and professional use.

Be aware, however, that there are strict requirements for what the businesses providing the software consider as an educational institution–if you do not meet them, you may not utilize them and need to search for other, preferably free, alternatives.

### **Interpersonal Blockers**

There's not much you can do with these, but think of interpersonal blockers as things like societal issues, cultural fit, gender, political affiliations, and more. There's plenty of red tape and blockers you cannot avoid, so be mindful of how you navigate the many relationships you have with coworkers, students, peers, and more.

If your facility or learning environment has an HR department, generally follow the guidelines and rules they tell you to follow, and you should be, for the most part, good to go.

If you don't have assistance or an HR department, here are things you should avoid in a classroom and teaching setting for your protection:

- Politics
- Religion
- Sexism
- Harassment
- Anything that intentionally–and unintentionally–causes physical harm to others.
- Bullying and bringing down people through your words and actions
- Relationships with students
- Relationships (in general)

What's the relationship between weightlifting and people? You lift weights and you lift people's knowledge. You want to lift other people, not put them down, and you want to maintain a safe, acceptable, and respectable distance between you and your students.

# 7. Metrics Of Success

## **Short Answer**

Depends on your goals, but metrics should be measures designed to be consistent and objective. Test scores are one standard–and visible–metric to base performance on.

**To quote Goodhart's Law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."**

## **Long Answer**

Though you're not typically in the business or finance sector, unless you're teaching about that or it's a job you have, there are some terms you need to know. There's a way to see if a change in your curriculum provides a boost. Metrics of success are measures verifying if strategies or implementations are working correctly. A measure can be subjective or objective and depends on the needs of the people utilizing the metric.

You want to choose the right metrics to gauge success. A single metric is not ideal, and you want multiple metrics, so you are less likely to make a metric a target and can show improvement in various ways. What those metrics are depends on the goals of the teacher and organization using them. Your goals as a teacher may align with maximizing outcomes, such as scores and pass rates, qualitative aspects, like engagement and relationships, or positive signs of growth, such as outlooks, views, and student character. It could be a combination of any of these as well, or some days your metric of success is simply making it to the next day.

There are two types of data associated with metrics: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data is a specific and objective measure capturing numbers, quantities, and ranges. Qualitative data is based on subject and explanatory measures of qualities, traits, and characteristics. In short, quantitative deals with numbers and qualitative deals with words/images. 

It is possible to convert qualitative data into quantitative data through methods like sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML). You can convert from quantitative to qualitative, but it is rarely done outside of categorizing, bucketing, and labeling. Quantitative data also goes into models optimized through techniques and heuristics like simulated annealing.

The details of these methods and all of these methods in general are beyond the scope of this writing, but raising awareness about them is helpful should you need to delve into deeper analysis in the future.

Qualitative data may work alongside quantitative data, or separate from quantitative data, depending on your needs. Some examples of quantitative metrics you may see in education are the following:

- GPA / Grades (Academic Performance)
- Support Service Utilization
- Time to Completion
- Graduation Rate
- Retention Rate (Churn)
- Post-Graduate Employment Rate
- Test Scores (State, ACT, SAT, IB, AP, etc.)
- Attendance / Participation

You'll want to be careful when measuring data. You are subject to multiple biases based on the type of sample you select and the demographics of the sample (i.e., students). Your interpretation of data and how students affect data is also at risk of data bias. Several examples of bias include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Confirmation bias
- Observer bias
- Selection bias
- Recall bias
- Reporting bias
- Sampling bias
- Survivorship bias
- Measurement bias
- Social bias

**As a human being, you will have a bias present in some way, form, or fashion; unconscious bias and human perception extend far and wide from person to person.** Unchecked and unaccounted bias will lead to detrimental effects. In the worst case, you may face legal and ethical consequences for inaccurate decisions made using the data collected and metrics produced. Reducing bias is done through strict verifications, transparency, and collecting data representative of the population rather than selective parts of a population to skew results.

You may see two standard terms used for metrics of success: Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). OKRs are for tracking progress and setting direction towards specific goals. In contrast, KPIs are for monitoring performance, outcomes, and statuses of one or more metrics over a period of time. KPIs are better suited for tasks done repeatedly, whereas OKRs are better for tasks you dismiss or change once reached. OKRs typically use qualitative data while KPIs use quantitative data.

As an aside, if there is a metric available, there is a way to "game" the metric or optimize the metric. Though such methods are available, remember your primary goal is whether or not students successfully learn what you're trying to teach. You may need to meet metrics, but you're still a teacher at the end of the day.

# 8. Source(s) of Truth

## **Short Answer**

**"Absence of Evidence is not Evidence of Absence" – Carl Sagan, Astronomer**

Even if you are the innovator and/or pioneer of the subject/field you are teaching, you won't know *everything* and you should expect to use external sources of information to reinforce and supplement your teaching. If you find someone who knows and can do everything and anything, please tell me so I can add them to my network and get an excellent professional reference for my future career path.

## **Long Answer**

There are two sources of truth you have to work with: the knowledge you've already acquired vs the knowledge you need to seek out and use in teaching.

For both ways, I like this quotation from the former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, which he delivered on February 12, 2002.

> *"Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones."*
> 

There are three explicit categories stated here: known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns. A fourth category was observed and added by Steve Rayner in 2012, called "uncomfortable knowledge," which I'll refer to as unknown knowns.

**About teaching, you get the following:**

**Known Known**
- The domain knowledge, skills, and expertise you learned through rigorous effort and/or time.

**Known Unknown**
- Areas of knowledge you have familiarity with, such as summaries and general information, but lack the specifics and details on.

**Unknown Known** 
- Judgments, biases, and preconceived notions towards new and old information, policies, and behaviors you do without always being aware of them.

**Unknown Unknown**
- Information that you are neither aware of, understand, nor can correctly predict and expect.

### Exploring Outside Your Field
Though Rumsfeld mentions unknown unknowns as difficult, I'd also categorize unknown knowns as equally challenging. Beliefs, suppositions, and practices we do not know of may form the values we know of, follow, and practice.

For your curriculum and meeting standards, you'll be dealing with mainly known knowns and known unknowns. You're able to teach because you know what you're teaching. For parts you're uncertain about on the subjects you're covering (known unknowns), you're able to find and research resources elsewhere, make sense of them, and incorporate them into your teaching. In the process of researching, you'll eventually come upon information that you may or may not use in teaching, but didn't know about before, existed, or initially thought relevant to your subject(s) (unknown unknowns). Funny how intelligence work is helpful in teaching, too.

Keep in mind you're not exclusively limited to the area you're teaching. I encourage you to look beyond your field for other information you may find helpful.

Say, for example, you're teaching engineering. You don't only need to bring in engineering resources; you can bring in case studies, articles, and examples from multiple fields like management, finance, aerospace, communication, and more. From there, you can use that to gain a new perspective, link it into the material you're teaching to reinforce ideas and show practical use, or use that newfound knowledge to reinforce *how* you teach.

Here is a small list of books I used for designing a curriculum.

Despite my teaching focus on science and engineering, I found helpful information in other sources, such as communication and design books. This list is a small sample, but shows an example where looking into information outside of your field can ultimately benefit you.

### Regarding Wikipedia

Lastly, I'll end with a note on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is excellent as a one-stop source for what you're trying to look up. For the average layman and in general, it's a good resource.

**Now for my criticisms of Wikipedia:** 
- Wikipedia is terrible for research and is not appropriate for essay or research citations, as it doesn't follow a scientific procedure to get information (there's some irony here considering how I'm writing this guide, but I digress). 
- Any person can create an account and submit edits to Wikipedia articles, which brings into question the credentials and background of the people writing the information in the first place. 
- **A Wikipedia article does not hold the same weight as a peer-reviewed research article, *even if they have the exact same information*, due to each source's credibility.** 
- Subject to the bias of the editors on any viewpoints they may add or opinions they bring in, even if the information is factually correct. 
- You also won't figure out the reputations of sources from Wikipedia alone, as Wikipedia is a compilation of information drawn from multiple sources. 
- Stuns the ability to do research, as students may think Wikipedia is "good enough" and not bother to research beyond that.
- Information you get from Wikipedia is straightforward to change. In contrast, books, peer-reviewed articles, and the like are *not* easily changed.

Despite Wikipedia's benefits and drawbacks, a student may inevitably use it, if not at least look at it. To counter this, consider implementing the following for work where students do research:

- If you look at Wikipedia, go to the bottom of the page/article and look for headers like "References" and "External Links." Use the information from *those* sources as research and citations.
- Wikipedia is OK as a starting point, but no further.
- Ensure you're able to evaluate sources properly through critical thinking. The following links are two ways of evaluating sources:

# 9. Communication, Design, and Usability

## Short Answer
Being a teacher also means being a designer. The materials you provide students are an extension of your teaching and communication with them. If you don't need to reinvent the wheel to teach your topic(s), then don't reinvent the wheel.

When in doubt, design for clarity and simplicity–even at the cost of some consistency. Designing goes for templates, assignments, tests, projects, activities, etc. The more clarity an assignment has, the more likely a student will do it with fewer issues.

**Some notable exceptions would be:**
- An assignment explicitly testing reading comprehension and analysis
- Research articles
- Practicing writing sentences (longer → shorter versions or in general)
- State testing and specialized testing
- This book

## Long Answer

**I want you to be aware of 2 things before continuing:**
1. There's a high chance someone else did what you want to do before you
2. There's also a high chance someone did something better than you before you

Reread those two things.

This isn't a means to dissuade you from creativity or teaching; it's a reality. Go ahead and do a Google search on any topic you want to do if you don't believe me.

Did a Google search and found your goal? Take a closer look, see how they did the topic, then guesstimate if you can do a better job than they did. What if you found something, but of poor quality, or you didn't find your topic? That's when you can flex your ability and creativity.

**If you don't need to reinvent the wheel to teach your topic(s), then don't reinvent the wheel.** Broken record reminder: time is your most valuable resource. 

If someone did something extremely well for a topic you're covering, it is OK to use that and apply it in your setting. It's valid and reasonable, in the interest of time, to stand upon the shoulders of giants. You can still cover that same topic if your approach is objectively better or increases accessibility.

Capitalizing on others is also a surprisingly common occurrence in businesses: one business may have a fantastic idea, but fail to capitalize on it correctly. Another business then comes across that same idea later. It executes it perfectly, making millions to billions of dollars in profit. You may not change the core facts surrounding the topic, but your timing and methods can improve.

You don't need to be the best at discovering or inventing ideas. Still, you do need to be good at selling/teaching ideas to prospective clients/students.

**Be mindful of a few things, though, when using others' work:**
- What you use aligns with the standards and objectives you need to follow.
- Using the appropriate attribution and following the content's licensing.
  - I did briefly mention the US Copyright Office in an earlier part. Still, there are other types of copyright (or "copyleft") as well, such as **[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/)** and **[MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit)**.
  - Normally, this is easily found, like in a License file, in a specific section of text, or on a separate page of a website. Other times, it requires in-depth searching.
- Understanding what you're using, reading, etc., when teaching from it.
  - This may seem obvious, but I do need to say it in an era where AI can generate an answer and people regurgitate it without critical thinking.
- You're able to utilize it as part of your curriculum, and the content does not face a blocker.
- You don't need to fix everything wrong with the borrowed content.
  - "Good enough" content done in a day is better than "perfect" content done in a month.
  - Focus on what's directly related to your standards and transferable first and foremost.

### The User (Student) Experience
Imagine you're using a website or playing a video game for the first time. You may not know how to use it to its full potential, or you're going in with some knowledge of conventions and standards about how this website or game should operate.

Students are much the same way. They're coming from multiple demographics, and each demographic shares some conventions in common, while others are less well known. 

It's an easy assumption to think students know how to navigate through the content like we do. In reality, that couldn't be farther from the truth. You may find your students–and maybe you–doing any of the following:
- Scanning text instead of reading text
- Settling on a reasonable first solution
- Stumbling through how something works

Does this mean they're wrong? Not necessarily; it means the material and work you're giving them is something they want to get through quickly.

You'll find students are going in with a goal in mind. That goal may be getting through the material as fast as possible. Another goal could be "What does X do?" In either case, they'll focus on that goal and tend to avoid materials that don't meet or satisfy their goal. To expand on what I mentioned earlier:
- If they want to get done quickly, they'll opt for scanning rather than reading instructions, figuring out the best solution, or just brute-forcing their way through.
- If they're figuring out how to perform a specific action, expect them to focus only on tasks that help them do that and potentially ignore everything else.

A misaligned goal is something you can mitigate to an extent. Any form of thinking takes up energy; if you can spend less energy thinking about something, then you'll likely do that. Your material could be the best and most fun in the world, but viewed as nothing more than work, which takes up time and energy that students would rather spend elsewhere. 

When in doubt, design your teaching materials so that they require as little thinking as possible. Conventional templates, multiple choice questions, and familiar formats may not look their best. Still, they require less mental effort to meet their goal and give back more time to do what they want. By extension, this means you get more time to have them focus on what you want them to learn; all by making it easier to meet their goal(s).

You can also teach new conventions and methods, but keep in mind that it may take students several iterations and exposures before they require less mental effort to think about how to do it.

### The Pareto Principle
You may have heard of the 80/20 rule before. That's what the Pareto Principle is. It's applied to many different scenarios and situations, but for a valid reason: 80% of the consequences come from 20% of the causes is a commonly observed event. It's a generally accepted rule (NOT law).

**There are some misconceptions to correct:**
- The Pareto Principle describes a commonly seen distribution of events.
  - E.g., 20% of people have 80% of all caulk. That same 20% of people also have a probability of owning any amount from 0% to 100% of all caulk.
- 80 + 20 =/= 100. 
  - It's possible 99% of people have 99% of something, which gives you a 99/99 distribution (or 99 + 99 = 198).
  - It's also possible 80% of people have 0% of something for an 80/0 distribution (80 + 0 = 80)
- It is related to a law (i.e., Law of Diminishing Returns) but is not a law itself.
- (Low Math Example) In a paragraph of 5 sentences, one sentence summarizes most of the paragraph.

How this applies to you as a teacher is this: focus first on the serious problems before tackling the not-so-serious issues. 

Don't know what the serious problems are? 
1. Make a list
2. Rate the items in order of significance
3. Make solutions 

Solutions don't have to be perfect; just good enough to effectively solve the problem.

### Accessibility
Outside of legal requirements like IEPs and 504s, you want to make sure your teaching material is accessible.

Does this mean more work? Yes. Does this also mean you can dramatically improve people's lives and experiences with slight effort? Also yes.

If you want two examples, think about blind and deaf people. Braille accommodates learning for blind people, whereas ASL (American Sign Language) accommodates deaf people. Because these demographics have these methods to communicate and learn, they're now on a similar stage of learning compared to peers without those disabilities.

You might also claim that accessibility will harm the design and content of whatever you're teaching. Outside of exceptional niche cases, that's not always true. I found that designing for accessibility won't compromise the design, look, feel, and delivery of a message. It significantly improved the curriculum and made things simpler to understand for all students. It also eliminated–or heavily mitigated–issues where students without disabilities likely encountered difficulties in one area, and students with disabilities experienced similar problems in the same area.

# 10. "Agile" Teaching Framework

## **Short Answer**

*Disclaimer: I built this framework in mind for secondary and tertiary education (middle school and above). Elementary school/primary education may need adjustments beyond what is here.*

- **The curriculum you design should mirror what students will do outside the classroom as closely as possible whenever feasible.**
- Many topics can fit into short, fixed-time periods of 1, 2, or 4 weeks/days and include a balance of lectures, activities, projects, and tests.
- Be ready and able to adjust lesson plans as needed, even on a day-by-day basis.
- *Every* subject requires teachers to communicate well through storytelling. If you cannot communicate well and hold students' attention, then you cannot get students to invest in your teachings and learn what they need to know.
- If it works as a summary, use a summary.
- Good lectures are not boring. Bad lectures are boring.
- **"If I am to speak for ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now."** – Former US President Woodrow Wilson

## **Long Answer**

**Here's a weird thought: Education is learning. Teaching is a *form* of learning.**

A student may only need to look up the information to learn about something or to solve a problem. They may not need to utilize the information afterwards. You, as a teacher or non-teaching individual, probably looked up something before on Google, got an answer, and (probably) didn't need to remember that answer later on because it solved your current question/problem.

A teacher, however, goes through multiple steps beyond looking up the information. They have to ensure the information is correct, figure out what parts they need to communicate, figure out the *method* of communication, then *execute* the communication to a broader audience, and adjust–sometimes in the moment–how a concept is presented.

**Paradoxically, teachers are often better learners than, well, students and may learn more new things about the same topic(s) compared to their students–the very people they're trying to educate!**

This gap in learning creates a void to fill with an important question: how does a *student* learn if they're not a teacher and trying to teach others?

### **Where does Agile fit into this?**

For those unfamiliar with Agile, here's the [**Agile Manifesto**](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). It's related to software development, but you can apply it in multiple industries. In practice, though, Agile goes through numerous types of implementation to various levels of success (E.g., "Scrumfall") compared to traditional waterfall practices.

When I was teaching, I settled on a 6/2/2 distribution for my curriculum. In a block of 10 "teaching" days (or two business weeks), this distribution splits into three categories:

- (60%) 6 days lecture
- (20%) 2 days projects and/or activities
- (20%) 2 days tests and/or review

I set this up because I had, in the worst case, 24 units in a single school year to cover. In science, I also had much theoretical information to cover compared to practical experiments to do. I had to be sensible. With this setup, I met standards, and I regained an entire week to explore other future concepts with students in the field of science!

More important notes with the above distribution:

1. Sometimes there are days you lose. It's possible, but difficult, to plan for losses like these, but you'll likely only be able to prepare 1-2 weeks out.
2. This distribution example is for a two-business-week (10-day) coverage of one unit. 1 week (5 days) would be 3/1/1 and 4 weeks (20 days) would be 12/4/4.
3. 1 or 2 week periods work best for me, because you won't go too in-depth when you should summarize instead, and you are less likely to get behind on your teaching schedule.

Some parts in each unit I can summarize and explain fully in a few sentences. Other parts required significantly more depth or required methods where typical text or verbal explanations alone were insufficient.

- Aside: If you want a "fun" way to practice summarizing, read graduate and PhD theses/dissertations and sum them up in layman's terms within two or fewer short sentences. Do that multiple times. It's easier than you think!
    - [**Here’s a link to start practicing**](https://opendissertations.org/)

**The stages of a Scrum "sprint" in Agile are the following ([further reading](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints)):**

- Planning
- Implementation
- Review
- Retrospective

Scrum is an Agile framework, and the sprint is a part of Scrum. The goal of a sprint is to ship out work on a product, or a completed product, at the end of each sprint. To put "product" another way, your goal is to complete parts of, or the whole, curriculum by your deadline.

I'll go over these four stages and where they apply in a teaching context below. Each unit or "cycle" repeats these four stages continuously from start to end during a school year, semester, or trimester. Though you go through iterations with a sprint, it's not ideal to go across stages in a sprint, such as moving from Implementation to Planning. It's best to go through a whole cycle of Planning, Implementation, Review, and then Retrospective whenever possible, as the Retrospective stage is time dedicated to adjusting your teaching approach, seeing what went wrong or right, and more.

### **Advisory**

Though I do a 6/2/2 setup, other subjects may need more student days dedicated to projects and activities rather than lectures, such as theater, art, athletics, and music. In those scenarios, you could do a 4/4/2, a 2/6/2, or even a 1/8/1 setup if it's primarily project-based rather than theory-based and/or exams aren't the primary way to check for competency.

If your curriculum is more project-based or heavily focuses on activities, dedicate more days to activities and working on projects. If not, dedicate more days to lecture and direct instruction. Always have some time planned for reviewing and tests to ensure material is retained.

### **Planning (Teacher)**

*"If I am to speak for ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now."* – Former US President Woodrow Wilson

The planning phase is what you spend the bulk of your time on and, more often than not, NOT during a class period. The majority is spent during assigned planning periods and outside of school. I also don't include it as part of the "6/2/2" setup because it's not days where students are heavily involved; it's mainly just you as a teacher.

Unlike a typical Scrum sprint, the Planning phase doesn't require the students to be present, but accounts for the capabilities and conditions of students, such as:

- Disabilities & Accommodations, such as IEPs and 504s
- What students can reasonably accomplish
- What skill(s) students have going into the course/unit

Before starting your planning, look for a set of standards or objectives (your product backlog) you need to cover and find the appropriate materials, such as textbooks, that cover or meet those standards and objectives.

*A typical planning phase for me looked like the following for each unit:*

- Review the unit material. You may know it, but it helps to confirm your knowledge.
- Make a list of the names and concepts to cover.
- Verify using the standards to see if I'm meeting goals on each unit.
- Verify with standards what material to test and quiz over by the end of the unit.
- Research additional sources if your current material does not cover all standards.
- Figure out ways to summarize each concept, in case time is cut short due to external factors.
- See what materials I need to bring in, if any, and assess what equipment I have currently.
    - For projects and activities, the Internet is a great place to search for plans, free online labs, and ideas for hands-on learning.
- "Block" out sessions by days and plan for around 5-10 minutes of "waste" or downtime during the period.
    - Downtime could also be time you're not actively teaching and having students work on something in the meantime in class.
- For secondary and primary education, figure out what material students should cover and/or work on when you're absent from school during part(s) of the unit.
- Do a second pass of your unit plan and refine the presentation materials
    - Visuals, diction, summarizing information, explanations, etc.

While this list seems long, it takes only a few times at most to go through before it becomes easy to adapt. Later on in my first year, this took up to 1 hour for each entire unit. You also don't need to write *everything* down on a lesson plan, but this may differ depending on the specific requirements and expectations of your teaching and administrators.

If you're struggling in the planning phase, don't worry. This part takes practice. In my situation, I eventually got each day/class down to lesson plans of 3-4 lines, which leaves me room to adjust and be flexible in a classroom:

- Titles of Section(s)/Activity to cover that day
- 1 sentence on the objectives
- Any other task(s) to cover if able to or if needed

Lastly, as a stern reminder, be aware that no plan you make survives first contact with students. Follow your lesson plans, but be prepared to deviate and adjust when needed and as situations outside of your control arise.

### **Implementation (Teacher & Student)**

Think of "Implementation" as your time to execute your plans made earlier in a teaching environment, whether in person or through distance learning. The majority of days for each unit are here. (6 days and 2 days, or 8 days total, from my original "6/2/2" setup).

There are two primary methods: lectures and projects/activities. There's also a part called "daily scrum" where you, the teacher, can quickly reassess your progress and make minor to moderate adjustments if needed.

***Lectures***

Lectures are the first "6" of my setup. Again, you can decrease lecture days for more hands-on classes.

These are sessions used to deliver–mainly verbally–a significant amount of information all at once to a student, or group of students, and allow them to ask questions.

**With lectures, you need to focus on three areas *alongside* the material you're teaching: passion, knowledge, and entertainment.**

**Passion is how much you care about what you're teaching.** If you can show you care–preferably in a genuine manner, but even an attempt is fine–then you can get students to care.

**Knowledge is how much you know about the subject(s) you're teaching.** It's entirely possible to teach by reading out the material, straight from a textbook. Still, your students may question your teaching ability if you also cannot successfully answer their questions, which leads to disengagement and less effective teaching.

**Entertainment is the ability to *hold* attention.** You don't need to dance like a monkey in front of students, but you also shouldn't be bland and monotone. If you're not able to hold a student's attention, they'll lose that attention. They may create problems for you *and* other students, negatively bringing down the classroom. Steve Jobs' speech with the iPhone reveal, TED Talks, TikTok, social media applications, and YouTube shorts are excellent examples of how you can hold the attention of people across all ages.

The combination of these three areas, with your teaching material, culminates in storytelling; the ability to tell engaging stories (or "sell" something that students "buy" into with their attention and willingness to learn).

Though some may criticize "sage on the stage" style lectures, with valid points, they are highly effective when done well. You are not limited to only words; you can use images, drawings, occasionally get students to follow along with something while lecturing, ask them questions about what you're teaching, and more. You can play off of student tangents relevant to your topic and have the tangent used as a question on a test, to keep students' attention by inserting the unexpected question here and there.

**Lecturing works great if the lecture is well structured. If not, then it does not work well.** It is a powerful tool for learning, but it requires preparation and dedication on the teacher's part.

***Activities / Projects***

Activities and projects are the first "2" of my setup. **I recommend doing no fewer than 1 to 2 activities or projects per unit, unless your material is nearly all theoretical,** as you may lose student engagement from over-repetition.

Activities and projects are ways to break the monotony of a classroom and force students to solve problems or perform work they otherwise cannot do easily in a lecture. These may be the toughest type to implement, because many things can go very wrong, very quickly.

If you haven't reviewed your safety measures for activities, plan to review them as soon as possible to ensure compliance. You can do multiple days if there are many procedures to cover. You also need to run a test to see if students truly know the safety measures, and space it between activity days, lecture days, and review days. How much you invest in safety talks depends on the subject(s) you're teaching. A class on math won't require as many safety talks as a class on wilderness survival, for example.

For activities and projects, do not be afraid to use the Internet for inspiration and gather ideas. Compared to finding textual information on how things work, it's much harder to find practical applications for that information.

**When I search for activities, I consider some of the following:**

- Does this activity meet the standards I have to follow?
- Do I–or can I–get the equipment for this without significant difficulty and/or cost?
- Is this safe for students to do or not?
- Can I fit this into in-class time, or does it require time outside of a classroom?
- Do I need to make additional materials or edits to the activity to accommodate students?
- How will I manage the activity inside the classroom?
- Do I need to account for disabilities or accommodations with the activity?

While many activities can be done on computers as of 2025, such as planetary orbit simulations, some activities *have* to be done in a physical environment and often are better done in a physical environment where students can touch, feel, and/or see what is happening.

Lastly, with activities, you're expected to manage students more than in lectures. Managing isn't necessarily a bad thing, but an observed fact of doing activities; you're giving students more freedom and not confining them (mostly) to chairs or in a single spot, so your role of keeping them on task intensifies greatly.

### **"Daily Scrum" (Teacher)** 

Think of the daily Scrum as your reassessment of your classroom and what you got done during the day. Do NOT go back to the planning stage yet.

After each day/class session, you can see which topic(s) were covered, how well they were covered, and then spend a bit of time making minor to moderate adjustments if needed. Do NOT make major adjustments after initial planning outside of emergencies; it is a time sink and an enormous headache.

### **Review (Teacher & Student)**

In the review stage, we get to the last "2" in my "6/2/2" setup. Review is when you're presenting the material you've implemented in the previous stage, whether through lectures, activities, or a combination of the two.

In teaching, review sorts out deficiencies in learning, identifying where students struggle with the material, and demonstrating that students have "done" the learning they need.

You can prove learning through tests, quizzes, review sessions, questionnaires, exit tickets, and more. For each of these sessions, you must explicitly define the test-taking conditions, such as what is allowed, what is not allowed, how much you can help a student with questions, how to take the test, the time allotted, and what other resources they may bring into the test.

There are two ways I would separate the review days, as my example accounts for 2 days' worth of time out of 10 days total.

1. 1 day of testing, 1 day of dedicated review
2. 1 day of testing, 1 day of review spread out among lecture days.

In both cases, dedicated testing is non-negotiable as you need an assessment with stakes to evaluate proper learning. The difference is how you review and check the "progress" of learning.

In the first method, this assumes you'll set aside an entire day to review every concept and standard for the unit. Many students may appreciate this as it gives them a "breather" and time to review and reinforce areas they may have forgotten or are lacking in. Other students, however, may not want or desire this, as they'd prefer not to spend the extra time and complete the unit more quickly. A dedicated review day also allows final adjustments to determine what to review and test based on current student progress.

In the second method, you'll still do a review, but typically at the end of each lecture day. As an example, instead of 50 minutes of dedicated review on one day, you take up the 5-10 minutes you initially allocated for downtime and "waste" and do shorter reviews on the concepts covered explicitly on that day. End-of-class reviews let you go through the unit faster, but require more pre-planning on the teacher's part to compensate for the lost in-class time. Additionally, you'll have to specifically remind students when a test is, as they may expect a review before the test rather than going straight into learning with a test the day after.

**In general, I recommend you go with the first method: 1 day of testing with 1 day of dedicated review.** The second method is more complex to implement and more challenging for students. Still, it does save you time, gives you the chance to cover more material within the year, semester, or trimester, and provides more buffer days in case of unexpected events.

### **Retrospective (Teacher)**

This part is outside of the "6/2/2" setup as it's done primarily through planning periods and not days where students are heavily involved. Additionally, the time spent here varies from minutes to hours, but you should not spend more than 2 to 3 hours here.

The retrospective is a time for you, as a teacher, to figure out ways to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of your teaching plans, style, presentation, and more.  You figure out what went well, what did not go well, what problems arose, and any solutions you made to solve problems you faced.

If you find significant improvements, assess the feasibility of implementation and then implement them. You may also discover new material that you didn't cover in this unit. You may need or want to cover it in the next unit.

### **“The One-a-week” Structure**

Sometimes you won't have multiple days per week for teaching and instead delegate a single day per week, across various weeks, for all of your class periods.

The 6/2/2 distribution still applies in this case, but it's a little different. Rather than days, you think in terms of hours. The same rules also apply if you need to change the distribution amongst lecturing, activities/projects, and review/tests.

For example, let's say you're in an adult learning session and you attend a class once a week. Each class period is 2 hours long. There are two ways to split this: intraday or interday.

***Intraday***

In an intraday setup, you're doing a varied distribution all within a 2-hour-long class period, and repeating this each day for every week. There are times when it's OK–and sometimes expected–to break this rule, such as when you need an entire day for a test or mostly an activity day.

Going back to our 2-hour example, your typical classroom day may look like this:

- (60%) ~72 minutes lecture
- (20%) ~24 minutes projects/activities
- (20%) ~24 minutes tests/review
- Total: 120 minutes or 2 hours

You'll still follow the same advice I mentioned for each category. You may replace part of your lecture test/review time with a 5-10 minute break to allow recuperation, downtime, or an excuse to grab a snack or a drink midway in class. You can subdivide that total time into further blocks, but no more than four blocks for each "topic" in this period. For example, one or two topics are lecture-heavy, but another topic is project activity-heavy, on the same day. You can distribute more "lectures" towards some topics and more "activity" towards other topics, all in the same day.

Keep in mind this setup requires strict planning on your part and equally strict time management, as it's easy to lose track of time and sacrifice time in one topic because you spent too long in another.

***Interday***

Interday is similar to a typical classroom setup. Still, instead of multiple days in one week, it is various days across many weeks.

This method is more straightforward compared to intraday because you can dedicate entire days to one type of learning, if applicable, to the subject at hand. The downside, though, is that you have to plan out what to say throughout that entire period actively, or you risk losing valuable teaching time due to poor planning.

Using the same 2-hour example, we can do another distribution like this:

- 3 days (3 weeks) of lecture
- 1 day (1 week) of project/activity
- 1 day (1 week) of review/test

You could combine lectures and projects/activities into 4 days rather than a 3-day split, putting lectures and activities on the same day. It depends on the needs of the class and if it's the best way to learn about what you're teaching.

***What if I have one day (or a weekend) for the entire curriculum instead of one day a week?***

Pretending you're combining multiple weeks into a day and scaling down the values and time estimates. You'll adjust some parts depending on the material and what you need to cover, but it is doable.

To give an example, let's say we normally need 8 weeks to teach a topic, but only have one workday (8 hours total). You could do something like this:
- 4 weeks of lecture --> 4 hours of lecture
- 2 weeks of project/activity --> 2 hours of projects/activities
- 2 weeks of review/test --> 2 hours split between separate review(s) and a test

Sprinkle in short breaks throughout the parts as needed or when the session requires it.

**Do not underestimate how long it takes to condense information. It can take a short or extensive amount of time to convert a long-term curriculum into a shorter one.

***Cost Overage vs Cost Underage (Teaching too much vs too little in X time)***

You may have seen these terms before in an engineering, supply chain, or production context, where underage costs are costs when you don't have enough inventory to meet demand, and overage costs are costs when you have too much inventory beyond demand. If you're unfamiliar with these terms and want to learn more, look for "Newsvendor Model" on Google or another search engine.

In teaching, overage and underage costs are part of your monetary costs and budgeting, but also a way to define if you're teaching the optimal amount of content in a given timeframe. This problem typically deals with supply quantities rather than timeframes, so my example may deviate from standard models.

You have a curriculum with a deadline of 26 weeks. You *have* to teach for the full 26 weeks, no more or no less, even if you get done with your material early. You cannot take longer than 26 weeks. Overage cost is what you incur when you cannot finish your curriculum in 26 weeks (due to excessive material or unplanned absences). In contrast, underage cost is what you incur when you finish the curriculum too early.

Your underage costs–If you get done early–could be additional material, supplies, and work to supplement any extra free time you have left. Your overage costs–if you take too long or are delayed too often past 26 weeks–are cutting content or omitting material to fit within the timeframe, which means you may not meet the appropriate standards you're supposed to cover.

There's also a chance you could go over or under your deadline of 26 weeks; you're not certain, as things can always affect your timelines from now until then. Your overage cost and underage cost weigh against those chances to determine whether or not you want to spend much time or a little time on specific subjects within your curriculum to meet a deadline, as well as when to "cut" out material to meet your deadline and standards.

The newsvendor model is one way to illustrate how having too little or too much material is costly and detrimental to all parties involved, beyond the production context. The example provided is highly simplified, and in real-world scenarios, there are significantly more costs and factors involved.

# 11. Learning Methodologies
## **Short Answer**

I'm not a proponent of "individual learning styles" ([**see here for further evidence**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249039450_The_Myth_of_Learning_Styles)). There are optimal ways to learn topics, but the best way varies from topic to topic, and you can teach in multiple ways at once. Direct instruction is an effective way of learning if done well.

- As an example, you can watch 10000 hours of violin playing, but it won't make you a virtuoso. 10000 hours of practicing violin playing will get you far closer to a virtuoso.

I'd personally recommend some form of learning with a combination of the following involved for students:

- Getting enough sleep
- Spaced Practice
- Interleaved Practice
- Varied Practice
- Experiencing and working through failure

## **Long Answer**

There are multiple ways to learn. A more common method is the [**Feynman technique**](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/), where you learn by selecting a concept and trying to explain it in simple terms. Another method is through flashcards with the [**Leitner system**](https://www.k-state.edu/aac/success-tools/collection/Leitner_System.pdf) or [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

Suppose you have ever coached or practiced sports before. In that case, you may have experienced spaced practice, interleaved practice, and varied practice but not know there were terms for it.

Sleep is important. Both students and teachers should not neglect it because it affects learning. How exactly sleep affects learning is outside the scope of this writing, but generally speaking, if you don't get enough sleep, it is harder to learn and retain knowledge over a long time.

### Types of Practice

**Spaced practice** (alternatively, "distributed practice") is the most straightforward. Rather than learning and cramming everything at once, you do the same material over multiple, *spaced*, periods. There is a strong emphasis on long enough breaks between the time you first learn material, followed by reviewing the material; the optimal point to relearn is somewhere around where you're just about to forget information. Spaced practice combats the [**forgetting curve**](https://e-student.org/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve/) to help with active recall and better memory retention of the topic(s) learned.

Before going into the next type of practice, I'll review "massed practice" next. Rather than giving time and learning over multiple sessions, massed practice is when you try to learn everything in a single session (or multiple, unspaced sessions) and hope the information sticks. That may work for Tony Stark when it comes to thermonuclear astrophysics, but for 99.9% of other students, that statistically does not work.

- If it *does* seem to work, it's an illusion of effective learning and there's a high chance you'll forget it all in a day, if not a week, after your learning session(s).

**Interleaved practice** is when you alternate what is being practiced or learned. For example, we spaced out tennis practice at specific times each day. Interleaved practice is doing multiple types of tennis techniques throughout the practice sessions, rather than only drop shots one day and backhands only the next; the day can *interleave* drop shots and backhand returns together in the same session.

**Varied practice** is another form of learning. To expand on the tennis example, we're already doing spaced days and interleaving different types of tennis techniques throughout the day. However, now we *vary* the context of the methods and their use. Do you use a drop shot when at the back of the court? What about the technique to use when you're suddenly near the net? You take the topic and the methods employed under that topic and vary based on how they're applied.

### Helplessness and Failure

Lastly, there's also dealing with the theories of learned helplessness, learned incompetence, and negative reinforcement. It may show at any age in humans and also shows up in animals, but is more common in younger age groups. In the context of students, these issues manifest most often when a student receives a difficult task. Rather than try to work through a task to the best of their ability, they may instead not attempt the task at all because it seems complicated or attempt it once and give up after only a single failure, waiting for someone else to do the work for them.

In teaching, these three concepts are surprisingly prevalent and can show up in many unexpected ways. Here are some examples:

- Student doesn't have a pencil? They may sit there until you give them a pencil, rather than searching for a pencil, to start work.
- Students have to retake a test? They may not care enough, despite repeated classwide reminders, or even a 1-on-1 reminder. Even if it is essential, they may still avoid it or not care enough to do it.
- Students need to practice a new skill? They may refuse to do it because they don't know how to do it.

Ironically, the easiest way for them to get used to failure is to force them to confront failure when it occurs rather than sidestep it. You may also see this with working adults, too: doing just enough work not to get fired, because they have seen good workers rewarded with more work to do. Depending on your school environment, this may be frowned upon or, worse, get you a stern talking to and other trouble because some institutions won't allow you to "fail" students. If you're not allowed to fail students, how will students ever experience failure to learn how to overcome it?

A reason why the teacher may avoid failing students is the amount of paperwork, legal and otherwise, required. Many teachers are subject to this paperwork requirement, while some may not be.

To illustrate: If a student gets a passing grade, even if it's a low passing grade, they're fine. If a student receives a failing grade, however, you may have to show proof of failure solely on the student's part. Remember to show you took every appropriate measure to try and teach the material to them to no avail. Ironically, the burden of proof is on you, the teacher, and not the student to show that the student failed on their merit. A method teachers employ to avoid failure is to provide enough points to "push along" the student into the next grade or out of the class. This response may be due to their sympathies for students or due to the administration not allowing them to fail students and pass everyone unless extreme circumstances, like blatant cheating, show otherwise.

Many students can act like they don't know because it's easier to do so, and it has worked for them before. If you can throw the accountability onto them and ensure they have the tools they need to complete the work–preferably with a method your superiors are approving of–then you can show proof of you doing your due diligence in case anyone asks about student issues later on.

Countering learned helplessness, faked incompetence, and negative reinforcement is simple: Do not help students unless absolutely needed and/or medically/legally obligated to. It's the best way I've seen to beat those issues: making students experience and overcome difficulty and failure.

### Performance vs Learning

When a student focuses on performance, their goal is to satisfy metrics–often quantitative, like a grade–and do no additional work beyond that. When a student focuses on learning, they'll invest less time in an explicit grade and more in understanding how and why something works. 

Ironically, students I've seen focused on learning score similar, if not higher, grades compared to students focused on performance. They're exploring the topic in-depth rather than a baseline effort to achieve a desired grade and no more beyond that.

If you're still unsure what to tell students about learning, I'll give you a list I've shown to my students. It's a rather long list, so you may do all the points or cherry-pick the points most relevant to your situation.

- Learning well requires going beyond passively learning about topics
- If you cannot solve problems or recall facts in practice, it's improbable to do so during a test (or applied scenario)
- The best methods are organic, but counterintuitive
    - What seems easy for learning may not help you learn as well
- Frustrations and difficulties are expected
- Better learning is possible at little to no additional cost
- Better to try and guess than give up
- Learning is not always fun or easy
- There are two ways of learning: the explanation/theory and the practice. Both are necessary.
- Massed practice provides a false sense of mastery
- Handwriting helps with retention more than typing
- Stating a concept verbally does not necessarily equal mastery of a concept
- People like success, so people avoid challenging problems/failure
- Some people place social acceptance high above the need to learn and understand information
- Helping out people who struggle too much is detrimental to them
- Goals matter more when chosen by someone rather than given

### What determines learning ability?

Though I disapprove of learning *styles,* there are still differences in how individuals learn and their capability of learning. To reference *Make It Stick* by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel, here are some examples: 

- Intelligence
- Dynamic Testing
- Structure Building
- Rule vs Example Learning

Your goal is presenting material in a way the student is best able to learn, not necessarily how they want to learn.

# 12. Homework

## **Short Answer**

The time spent in class should make up for the time spent on homework, and this varies significantly by subject.

## **Long Answer**

Recall the previous section where I talked about blockers to student learning and the ability to teach.

Homework *can*–but not always will–infringe on those four blockers I talked about: technology, physical, monetary, and interpersonal. Student A may not have the same support systems as Student B. Even though you gave them the same assignment, they may not have the same opportunities and availability to complete it to the best of their ability.

The goal of equity here is providing *opportunity* to those in less fortunate circumstances or those with disabilities or impairments.

Before you start parading equity as the end-all, be-all solution, consider the following argument:

In tertiary education, like college, you may only see your professors for 3 hours *each week* in a semester. In secondary education, such as high school and middle school, you may see teachers for about 50 minutes to 1 hour per day, if not more, Monday to Friday each week. The in-class time you have across different types of education varies significantly, so what you can get done during class and teach, review, practice, etc., also differs significantly.

It's why college classes expect *more* out of students outside of class compared to high school classes. The total work may be about the same in both education levels (unless it's post-graduate, then definitely more outside work). Still, the amount of work you can do in a classroom in college is less, so there's more out-of-class work to compensate and make up for the practice, learning, etc., you need. The work amount is by design and due to the constraints imposed upon teaching. Professors and teachers aren't always giving you homework because they dislike you; they're doing it to stay within deadlines and to get you the appropriate practice for the material they're covering to ensure you're learning as they intend you to.

In a high school or lower educational setting, you may only need some to no homework depending on your subject and how rigorous the class is (e.g., AP History vs. "normal" history). For subjects like music, athletics, and math, there is a significant amount of learning by doing over listening/remembering only, so homework is likely. For other subjects, more work is doable in class, so it doesn't *always* have to become homework and give more work outside of an 8-to-4 or 7-to-3 schedule secondary and primary education students already have to follow.

Now, to talk about why homework for students means more homework for you, the teacher.

### Do I give more or less homework?

Every assignment you issue is an assignment you'll likely have to grade. Multiply that by the number of students you're teaching, and you may find, just grading alone, homework may take hours, if not multiple work days, to accomplish.

Multiply that value again by the number of students for whom you have to rewrite the assignment due to disabilities and accommodations. What seems like minor changes and a simple homework assignment inevitably scales exponentially as you have more students. Remember, time is your most valuable asset; you do not want to waste it.

You should not give out homework you are not willing to grade, if you can help it. If you do have to give out graded homework, figure out if there's a way to automate or quickly accomplish the grading process. If you cannot automate it or quickly grade it, then see if you can structure or refine the assignment for more efficient grading, whether by limiting the number of questions or the types of responses permitted for questions.

Multiple choice questions, math/science problems with discrete solutions, and any questions with one solution work best here, because all you need to do is make a key. If their answers don't match your answers, it's easy to cross-reference and grade.

- In data analysis terms, it's matching 1-to-1 questions to answers, rather than 1-to-many questions to answers.

These types of questions are easy to automate compared to qualitative problems and questions with a multitude/range of correct answers, which means you save more time. We like saving time.

The method I stuck with was "implied homework" for teaching, which meant explicitly telling students I'm putting the responsibility on them to properly prepare for tests, assignments, etc., based on any information and explanations I gave during classroom time. I told students what to expect from the test and what I'll try to cover in each unit. 

Suppose I don't go over a particular subject. In that case, I figure out if there's a way to summarize it and potentially exclude it from a unit's exam. 

This setup eliminated virtually all of my homework, except for math-heavy science and engineering topics, but vastly increased the number of "tests" I issued at the end of each unit in-class to compensate and ensure students were adequately prepared for and learned the appropriate subjects.

Another "implied" homework I gave, but didn't explicitly grade, was allowing a "cheat sheet" for tests. Cheat sheets had varied results, so if I were to do it again, I'd do the following:

- A notecard size at most. An entire page of 8.5 x 11 paper can fit in nearly the whole exam if a student is willing to write small enough–and they most certainly are eager.
- Force it to be in writing. It forces students to commit to what they should put on a cheat sheet vs trying to remember, and stops the "copy+paste" problem of computer-based notes.

There are cases where you can permit an open book test as well, but reserve those for topics with exceptional depth and where a student should utilize how to *find* things in the book(s) allowed for answers rather than knowing every detail in the book.

Overall, though, don't give out homework unless necessary. Try your best, as a teacher, to accomplish what you need to get students to learn within the classroom setting.

___

# 13. Teacher-Client Relations

## **Short Answer**

Working with people outside of students, like parents and administrators, is also necessary. If you cannot do this well, you'll have a hard time making it through teaching and getting any support you need. If you treat your peers well, you'll (likely) get treated well in turn.

You'll also need to learn how to work with people you disagree with and not take things personally.

## **Long Answer**

***Disclaimer: This section is more heavily opinionated.***

### Primer on Psychology (kind of)

Before we go into how to deal with people, I should briefly talk about their goals and unconscious bias. If you know what someone's goal is, you'll have an easier time rationalizing and dealing with them. There are times goals vary among different people in the same position, so this is a comprehensive overview. As a teacher, you'll deal primarily with administrators and parents, as well as other teachers. Depending on your role or needs, you may also deal with agencies.

As for bias, it's unavoidable, ever-present, and unlikely to go away anytime soon. It's the things people don't *say* they do, but still do it anyway–the unknown knowns.

Here's an example: your gender affects people's expectations of you. They aren't *saying* it does, but it does. If you're a male, you're more likely to get away with doing the minimum/putting in less effort. Still, you also have more hard lines drawn with disciplining certain things, like dress code, which are more likely to be assigned to de-escalate situations, and are more restricted on what you can talk about in general. If you're a female, then you can comfort students without fear of retaliation more easily. Still, at the same time, you'll deal with students who have no trouble questioning your authority and all types of people judging you significantly more on your appearance.

Also, with gender, teachers and professors are not classified as a "bona fide occupational qualification" (BFOQ), so you legally cannot discriminate by gender for who gets into a teaching role in the United States (**[Further reading on BFOQ](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/cm-625-bona-fide-occupational-qualifications)**). This ruling may differ for other countries and sovereign states, however. Despite explicitly written laws with very narrow scopes, the bias still exists and permeates teaching culture extensively.

I could go on and on about more examples of biases students and non-students show towards teachers. Still, you're better off researching topics like "unconscious bias," "implicit bias," and "hidden bias" on your own time. In short, everyone has some level of unconscious bias, but the questions to answer are which biases they have, how they manifest, and how to deal with them.

### **Administrators**

We'll start with the principal, dean, and assistant principals, as they're your "boss." They want the school to perform well, and they are responsible for its success or failure. Think of these roles as C-Suite executive positions, such as CEO, CFO, and CTO. They oversee a company–the school, in this case–and report to a Board/Department of Education, who approve or denies actions principal(s) may push forward on. That same board also has a "vision" or standards they want the CEO/principal to execute for the good of the school, properly. 

In plain business terms, the Board/DoE wants a good return on the investment they put into the school. Ironically, the power a principal holds over teachers is limited by their hands being tied for many issues outside of their control, such as state and federal legal consequences for actions.

Unlike typical teaching (and designing) roles, principals and deans are more public-facing and deal with the brunt of *most* complaints and outside interference, such as the Department of Education, agencies, councils, parents, and more. They also deal with budgeting, meetings, staffing, planning, decision-making, operations, policy-making, public speaking, marketing, managing personnel (like teachers) across different disciplines, and significantly more. There's also much undefined work because these roles may need to do multiple duties outside of their work routine.

For smaller schools, you may need only a single principal, and sometimes the teachers will pitch in to cover deficiencies. For larger schools, you'll still have one "principal." Still, many roles are divided or partitioned out amongst multiple people, such as assistant principals or deans. These roles assume some duties similar to a principal, but specialize in specific duties (such as discipline), groups of students (such as finance major students), or specialized administrative tasks (such as Legal Counsel and HR Manager). The principal still has a hand in the affairs of everything at the school and has a surprisingly large amount of legal power.

As a teacher or instructor, your role is to produce the results the principal(s) need you to achieve with your students. Outside of that, when dealing with administrators as a teacher, you want to do the following:

- Communicate within the "chain-of-command" about issues. Sometimes you go straight to the principal, direct-to-head, and other times through an echelon below, like an assistant principal.
- Talk in a calm, polite, and respectful manner with them.
- If you need to "hold your ground" against them, expect to present evidence of why your stance is correct and consider what issues may occur with your stance.
    - There are times when you'll still lose holding your ground despite doing everything right. That's life.
- Keep written documentation of interactions with administration.
- Have them be aware of additional laws related to your subject, like with special education or gun safety, if relevant.
- Keep your opinion(s) to yourself unless asked for them or it's a significant issue affecting your teaching environment.
    - Remember: they have a lot to deal with already.
- If you come in with a problem, expect to come in with a potential solution too.
    - No one likes complainers, and administrators already deal with complainers.
- If you're unsure *why* a decision is made, stick with asking questions and clarification rather than forthright opinions.
- Keep your gradebook and lesson plans up to date.
- If you make their job easier, they will make your job easier.

Your best bet is to focus on becoming a more effective teacher, improving your curriculum, resolving issues independently, or improving professional relationships with students and staff.

### **Parents & Adult Students**

Imagine you own a business, but you're a teacher. Now imagine your "clients" are the parents of your students or, if old enough to be legally independent, the students themselves. Sometimes your administrator will support you in handling this category. Other times, they'll actively be against you. It depends on the administrator, and it's less something you can easily change.

The goal of parents is to ensure a good education, future opportunities, and a safe environment for learning for their children. A parent's logic is not necessarily standard logic; what seems sane to parents may not seem rational to non-parents.

For parents of students, you'll want to keep in mind the following:

- Keeping a paper trail of interactions whenever possible.
- Ensuring they are aware of policies of the school and your classes their children, as students, are in.
- Be ready to explicitly show them what is happening with their children in your classes, such as grades, disability accommodations, progress plans, and more.
- When meeting with them, consider having another teacher or administrator around as a witness to protect yourself.
- If there is a learning plan, such as IEP/504, to check if the parent is *also* fulfilling their duties as part of the plan, if the parent has any explicitly defined roles and duties.

For adult learners, you'll still want to treat them like students, but you've got a lot more leeway about what you can say and how you can teach. You aren't restricted any longer by "age-appropriate" content, but you still have "classroom-appropriate" content to deal with. Even though they are adult students, please do treat them like students and guests, not as your friends, while teaching. You can teach them as friends, sure, but you're in a position to *teach* them, not *befriend* them. Keep boundaries up during the teaching period still.

It also may help when students are adults, as they face significantly more legal repercussions if they cause issues. It's a forthright way of saying it helps classroom management without you doing any extra work.

With both groups of people, you'll want to set expectations from day one, if not even earlier than day one. It saves you time and also quickly establishes the environment they're dealing with.

### **Other Teachers**

You'll likely work with other teachers. If the school is small, you may be the only teacher present for a particular grade or field of expertise. Still, if the school is larger, you may be amongst other professionals in similar areas to what you're teaching, like multiple engineering professors in a single department.

In any of these cases, you'll find yourself working with teachers of varying skill levels, experience, and backgrounds. You can "talk shop" with them, going over curricula, figuring out if something works well here and can be applied there, or how one student is managing across classrooms.

Please do note, though, that much like other professional workers, they still need a space for breaks. Not every hour of every day requires you–or other staff–to talk to them about teaching. Talk about other things during downtime, like outside life, sports, etc.

With more sensitive topics like religion and politics, avoid talking about those still unless you're sure the other teachers you're around are OK with civilly discussing these topics.

### **Secondary & Primary Education Students**

**Why do students fall under clients? It's because they're the ones receiving your services–what you're teaching them!** This category is for students still considered minors. The biggest thing to note is that minors don't follow the (exact) same rules as adults when it comes to learning, and it's in their name: they are *not* adults. Sometimes, younger students genuinely do not know any better because they haven't been *taught* any better; you're often working with a (mostly) blank canvas.

For students in general, you want to go in with as few assumptions as possible; the fewer, the better. Here are some assumptions you can safely make about students, but also be ready to change them if needed:

- The students you're teaching do not know the material you're teaching extensively.
- What seems easy to you may be complicated for them
- May not be as motivated to learn or put in the work as you are to teach
- There are emotions and feelings that a student may not be able to express well
- They may not be familiar with the same tools you are familiar with (like computers)
- They may not follow your instructions well and/or correctly the first time
- They may lack basic skills

These assumptions focus on what you may experience as a student goes into your classroom for the first time. It isn't prudent to make bad assumptions about students in general, as it'll heavily affect how you approach teaching and rapport. Still, you'll likely form an established opinion about the student(s) later on based on their *actions done* and *words said* during class.

With assumptions out of the way, think of students as clients you're trying to sell your material to. This is where storytelling comes in and captivates an audience to engage with your material. If they don't find it engaging, then they will not engage. You could hold the threat of a grade over them, which can work sometimes, but not always.

They'll be interested in fun activities precisely because they *are* fun, but may avoid activities that are not fun. Older students may view unfun activities more negatively, but objectively, in terms of payoff vs time and effort put in. These students lose motivation due to the reward structure and how the class is structured, more so than anything you say as a teacher.

One strategy I've used, to some success, is explicitly asking the students what kind of activities they want to learn and do. Their choice(s) are the units and information I must cover per my standards. Still, this method ensures they have a way to "buy in" or invest their time into what I'm teaching. For already motivated students, this won't do much. For students on the fence or less motivated, it serves as a tipping point to raise motivation and make them feel like they have a stake in what they want to learn, which is something you can provide them.

Lastly, keep in mind students of all ages are still *students.* They are not your friends. You can interact with them in a friendly manner, but you are ultimately there to teach them. It's the same in business outside of teaching; you may be good friends with a supplier, but there's still some expectation of reward or money you give them rather than only altruistic feelings amongst informal friend groups. You'll need to set expectations and establish clear boundaries, and enforce any punishments fairly that follow for breaking those expectations.

### **Support Staff**

Last, but certainly not least, are your fellow support staff. These are people who work in the same environment, school, etc. as you, but aren't necessarily your manager/boss or a teacher like yourself. Support includes secretaries, custodians, maintenance staff, paras, security, nurses, cafeteria staff, groundskeepers, and more.

Without these staff members, your school wouldn't be able to keep rooms clean, take care of the learning environment, and maintain a safe and orderly environment. It would force you into taking on more administrative tasks as well. In short, **they help *you* do *your* job–albeit indirectly.**

To keep it simple, treat them well. If you don't, you'll find yourself saddled with bad conditions and more work very quickly.

# 14. Assistant Teachers

## **Short Answer**

This category of teachers and teaching assistants is *assisting you*, not taking over for you. If you have them, plan as if you may not have them initially in case they are not available and/or not doing the necessary aid you require.

## **Long Answer**

As I have not explicitly worked in one of these roles (at least long-term), I'll focus on interactions between these roles and a teacher/professor and observations I made throughout multiple schools.

Recall how I mentioned the principal has a significant number of tasks and, when the workload is sufficiently large, they will bring on people to assist or offset that workload. These are the assistant principals, who have tasks delegated to them or specialize in a particular task that a principal typically focuses on.

There is a similar relationship between teachers, specifically "general education," and professors, as well as assistant teachers, like "SPED" (Special Education), "Paras" (Paraeducators), TAs (Teaching Assistants), co-teachers, and substitute teachers. The difference between you and them is significant, though; even though there may be many co-teachers, there is still a primary teacher, which is likely you if you're reading this.

### Assistant Teacher Types

**Special Education (or "SPED")** is a department consisting of 1 or more paraeducators, colloquially called "paras" by staff and students alike. In many states in the US, paraeducators don't need teaching licenses or credentials. However, they are still professionals working alongside certified teachers. Each paraeducator usually focuses on 1 or 2 students at a time to meet their IEP/504 requirements and any other educational requirements. Meeting these requirements ranges from basic assistance to meet the current curriculum of students without the need for highly modified curricula. Paraeducators may need additional guidance on the material covered, as they also have to worry about your class and every other class the student goes into.

**Teaching assistants, or "TAs,"** are what their name implies: assistants for a teacher or professor. The requirement for a TA generally is someone, like a past student, with a high success rate/performance in the material you want them to assist with. They do entire lectures, grading, proctoring, lab assistance, answering questions about material, and more. 

They're like mini-teachers, and their goal is to take off the workload for teachers and professors. Hence, the primary teacher/professor gets more time to focus on other endeavors, like research and curriculum improvements. They'll have familiarity with some of your content knowledge, but probably not familiarity with all the same content knowledge as you. In colleges and tertiary education, TAs may hold lectures and labs with students without a teacher/professor present. In secondary education, they *may not* hold classes without the assigned teacher or a substitute teacher covering the absent teacher(s) present in the area.

- Depending on the subject(s), your TAs may need licenses and certifications to assist you in the classroom. Check with any relevant authorities or administrative bodies before bringing on a TA.

**Co-teachers** are licensed teachers assisting with multiple parts of a classroom. Of the categories listed, they are the only ones required to have a teaching certificate or license. Their duties may range from splitting all work evenly amongst themselves and the primary teacher, to focusing on paperwork, overseeing underrepresented dynamics, and working with kids with special needs, IEPs, 504s, and disabilities so that the primary teacher can focus on students without special needs. Of note with co-teachers, they may have as much training and content knowledge as the primary teacher, but also may not have the same background as the primary teacher. Sometimes, co-teachers may be people who can translate your lessons into another language or devise ways to ensure your lessons accommodate multiple people.

**Substitute teachers** are teachers with either a teaching license, a substitute teaching license, or a vetted adult in private school settings. They won't always have the same background as you do, but in case you need to take time off, they can legally replace you in a classroom setting. Keep in mind they may not be able to teach your subject–unless you give clear enough instructions and they have a background–so they are treated closer to a TA rather than a co-teacher. If it's a substitute who you're unsure of teaching in your place, the days you are out are better assigned as work days, which are like project/activity days on the framework from before. Be advised, though, that a substitute teacher fully assumes the role and responsibilities of the teacher they cover, so whatever you can do as the primary teacher, they can do much of the same. You place a moderate level of risk in a substitute teacher, as students may not get as far as you intended with them while you are absent. You can get them into trouble with administration, though, if they do a poor job, and a substitute teacher should leave you a note or short report on how the day went in your classes.

### Handling Assistant Teachers (In-Depth)

Managing assistant teacher expectations and how they assist you depends on communication and expectations. I'll put it this way: if you're a primary teacher, don't expect your assisting teachers to know what to do if you don't define what they *should* do. 

**Here's an example list of things to ensure are covered, or at least noted on, when you're meeting or corresponding with assistant teachers:**

- How to handle special needs students, like IEPs, 504s, and disabilities
- How to split up students (e.g., two teachers in one large group, or one teacher each for two small groups)
- Defining the roles and responsibilities of the teacher and assistant teacher(s) to avoid "overstepping" and determine which people hold accountability
- Decide how much–and which–planning and preparation for the classroom is done by each professional
- Tell the assistant teacher(s) what they need to do during the class
- Pet peeves, goals, support methods, classroom strategies, and expectations
- How much does the teacher want the assistant teacher(s) to help with planning
- How the teacher and assistant teacher(s) can get along with each other
- How to handle meetings with students/other staff and who attends them
- How to split the workload on teaching and preparation *during* the class
- Defining how much assistance is too much for the students and behavior expectations
- Any contact details and who to contact in case of situations, emergencies, etc.

**To sum up the above, you need to communicate what you need done, and you need to share any materials with any assistant teachers.** As for implementation in the real world, teachers' and assistant teachers' methodologies and their nuances are as varied as the number of teachers in the world. You'll have to experiment on your own, with your assistant teachers, to determine what works best for you, the students, and the assistant teachers.

Sometimes, the co-teacher is new and needs experience. In that case, you're better off imparting some preparation and teaching work rather than only assisting in the background. If the co-teacher's end goal is becoming a teacher, *they need to learn how to be a teacher and not an assistant*.

**Some setups I've seen work "well enough" in practice are:**

- One teacher acts as primary and the co-teacher does 1-on-1, or small group, work and assistance with select student(s) to keep as many students as possible on pace with instruction.
- Two teachers split a large group into two separate groups to teach the same thing at a lower teacher-to-student ratio.
- Two teachers split a large group of students into two groups and cover different specialties within the same subject, such as one teacher going over violins and the other teacher going over cellos.
- A co-teacher who "pretends" to be a student and does the work like students in the classroom, while the primary teacher teaches as if they are by themselves, so the co-teacher can communicate questions and relate to students better.
- The primary teacher assumes most teaching duties. At the same time, the co-teacher focuses on learning aids, accessibility, and translation of the classroom material and topics covered.

With assistant teachers, you'll want to plan as if they may not even be present, or if present, unable to do work, in the classroom. Things happen, expectations fall apart, communication breaks down; there are myriad reasons for something going awry if it requires two or more teachers to do a general lesson instead of 1 teacher. The last thing you need is a job and success that are heavily dependent on another person.

There are also times when an assistant teacher can make things *worse* for a classroom. If your assistant teacher does something like the following:

- Provides too many answers to questions that students are supposed to answer themselves
- Talks over you and/or distracts the class with talking when only you should be talking
- Overstepping explicitly defined boundaries.

Then you need to make time for a meeting with that assistant teacher. Document, by writing, during or after the meeting. If the issues are severe enough, consider bringing in a principal or HR, alongside any documentation showing evidence of problems caused by the assistant teachers. While they may be in a "teaching" position like you, there is always the risk that they are detrimental to your learning environment.

Lastly, I want to go into another category: **a teacher of record or alternative teaching license**. Some states adopt a teacher of record pathway to a license as a means to address teacher shortages. You'll still need to be part of a teacher preparation program for the license. Still, you're permitted to do work in a classroom setting usually reserved for the preparation program. It's accessible to professionals in other fields outside of teaching to transition into teaching. Keep in mind you'll still need transcript proof of any subject matter knowledge. You may have to pass additional exams, like the PRAXIS. There are a lot of other requirements in play that I'm not privy to and won't cover here, but know this pathway to teaching does exist.

# 15. Guest Teachers, Speakers, and Presenters

## **Short Answer**
These are NOT substitute teachers; they're people who are not the primary teacher, scheduled and arranged to come in for a limited time to teach one or more topics to your students.

Suppose there's a topic you want to teach that you usually cannot teach due to licensure, certification, or disclosure agreements. In that case, you could have a guest, who is NOT a teacher, come in to teach or present.

Keep in mind that whether or not guests are allowed is dependent on administrative approval over teacher approval, as it involves many legal procedures.

## **Long Answer**
*Notice: This section deals mainly with education involving minors and younger students, rather than adult students. Adult students in tertiary education may have different procedures I'm not personally familiar with, so I will not speak on them in-depth. I'm also purposely going overboard on some requirements, so you can scale down as allowed.*

Imagine this scenario. You are a music teacher and you are friends with a famous artist, band, or other notable figure. For purely example purposes, let's go with Pink Floyd. I like Pink Floyd and their album The Dark Side of the Moon. They have a lot of credibility when it comes to musical ability, and the students get to meet a pretty famous band in person.

You contacted them, they agreed to come over, and you have a date and time. Seems all good so far!

Except, well, you'll still have blockers.

**First, can they legally be in the area you're teaching?** 

Some laws restrict people with specific crimes on their record from living, being near, or working in educational settings. If they fall under this category, you're extremely unlikely, if ever, to get them in the area legally.

**Secondly, have they passed verified background checks?** 

Background checks aren't something you will normally verify and conduct. Federal authorities, principals, and other support staff inside and outside of the school will do this for personnel in workplace settings. Some schools may have a verified adult list to allow select individuals to do extracurricular activities and/or a list to ban specific individuals as well.

**Thirdly, was it approved by your boss (i.e., the principal/dean/assistant principal)?** 

School settings are strict about who is allowed on campus, so unless they have the stamp of approval from the administration, they may not access the campus. 
- There is still a possibility of allowing the guest teacher session, but outside of campus. In this case, you'll need to worry about field trip procedures and likely require similar, if not more, permissions to go forward with the guest teacher experience.

**Fourthly, did you explicitly define the conditions IN WRITING (yes, get it in writing when possible) for the guest teacher**, such as: 
- How long they're teaching for with BOTH start and end dates
- Which part(s) of the campus are they using, if any
- What subject(s) are they teaching
- What equipment are they permitted to bring into the classroom, and/or what equipment are they NOT permitted to bring into the classroom
- What you, the teacher, will be doing or allowed to do during the guest teacher periods
- Any other stipulations and rules needed to ensure a smooth classroom experience
- What accommodations are needed, if any
- What check-in and check-out procedures are involved at the campus
- To what extent are they permitted to interact with students for activities 
- What happens if any rules are broken, and what are the consequences, if needed
- Monetary costs payable to the guest teacher, if any

**Fifthly, were there any monetary costs you need to cover?** 

Don't forget that many guest teachers and presenters are adults and very likely need money as compensation for their work. If you don't pay them the amount they ask for, then they won't do what you want them to do. Simple as that. If they're volunteering or doing it for free, then you don't need to worry about this.

**Got past all the checks! Now what?**

Even after meeting these blockers, you'll still have to make sure they also follow the rules defined and set by you and anyone else in the timeframe specified, or else you'll deal with removing them rather than keeping them in the classroom.

After all of the checks and procedures to make sure they're allowed in the classroom, it's similar to a standard classroom. It's them as the teacher and you doing whatever role(s) you've defined.

Suppose explicit roles weren't defined for you, the teacher, and the guest. In that case, I'd remain in the classroom and near the students. This standard procedure helps address any emergencies or concerns the guest teacher is unable or ill-equipped to handle. It also protects me, students, and the guest(s) in case of any unforeseen liabilities or situations we did not originally plan for.

**If you want to get a guest teacher or presenter, it's OK to do–and sometimes encouraged–but make sure you have all the legal stuff and background checks squared away before the time(s) they're present.**

# 16. Passporting & Information Transfer

## **Short Answer**

Sometimes you need to help get a fellow teacher–or substitute teacher–set up in a classroom. You may not have to do it often, but it's better to know how because you may still need to do it.

## **Long Answer**

I'll split this up into two sections: teacher-to-teacher and teacher-to-substitute.

### **Teacher-to-Teacher**

Take, for example, a new employee is coming in, or a more seasoned one is transferring in for the first time. There's an orientation period where they're getting their bearings and understanding the environment. This general process isn't exclusive to teaching; you may see it in tech, nursing, and other jobs.

Pretend you are the older teacher, rather than a newer teacher. Here are things you may want your new junior to know and have, which may include the following:

- Contacts for other staff (emails, primarily).
- Building plans, or where things are located on the campus (like a coffee machine).
- How the printer/copier works.
- Where their office/classroom is.
- Technologies and learning systems the faculty use.
- Notes about any particular students to be mindful of.
- How to do shared planning and collaboration among staff members.
- Where to get resources for their class(es), whether electronic or physical.
- What you're doing to teach X subject (if both of you teach similar subjects).
  - You don't necessarily need to share your whole curriculum, but you can help the other teacher develop one over time.
- What to do in case of emergencies.
- Where are medical supplies.
- Guidelines on what other teachers should be allowed to help the new teacher with.
  - This is so a new teacher isn't too coddled and allowed to teach on their own.
- Any soft skills they should be mindful of.
- How to observe their classrooms (if needed).
- How to set up coverage (substitute teachers, etc.).
- How to build routines, establish behaviors and rewards, and management.
- Any plans for check-ins for newer teachers, like weekly meetings, collaboration sessions, etc.
- Ways to provide more time to "catch-up" on teaching duties.
- Class Schedules
- Who you're working with, whether it's by department, smaller group, etc.
- Access to the room(s) they’ll be using
- Sample Lesson Plans
- Instructions for grade/attendance/reporting system(s)
- What are the organizations new teachers need to interact with or have a line of communication with for parts of their curriculum

It's a long list, but keep in mind you'd want a teacher to stick around rather than muddle around and then depart. If you're able to get a new teacher who can stand on their own feet, then they will cause fewer issues for you as well. It's a mutual benefit for all involved. You could even include almost all of this on a single Google Document to distribute.

### **Teacher-to-Substitute**

For people taking over your class on days/times you're unavailable, it's more like you're giving them a laundry list of things to watch out for and how to manage that class. The rule of thumb is that the simpler the plan, the more likely it is to be followed.

It could be simple, like "here are the worksheets; make sure they do them," or something complex. Remember that whoever comes in as a substitute may not know your subject area, so plan accordingly. Your substitute may not even read your plans, which means you have to post the work online or distribute worksheets and hope the students complete the job.

Despite the simplicity, or complexity, of substitute plans, you'll want to make a "standard" template and an emergency substitute teacher plan. Emergency plans ensure you don't get in trouble when you can't create plans for a particular time frame. Substitute teachers may access information protected by FERPA/HIPAA so long as it pertains to your classroom. Still, they are on a "should know" basis rather than "may know."

Here are some things you should note down and divide by each class/subject for the times you are unavailable in these plans:

- A work plan of what the class is doing during the period(s).
- Any important notes about students.
  - E.g., Medication times, who has learning plans like IEP/504, etc.
- Noteworthy students with extra classroom roles, such as a student stepping up as a conductor in a music class or student assistants actively helping in the classroom.
- Any passwords, access codes, and permissions needed to run the classroom properly.
- Who to contact in case of emergencies/help.
- How the classroom is managed.
- Your email, or a way to contact you.
  - Avoid giving out your phone number unless that's your only contact.

**Example work plan for a given period:**

- Students do [Assignment] today.
  - Available on [Platform/Medium] located [Computer/Desk/Etc.].
  - Work is turned in [Online/Physical Location/Kept].
  - Expected to complete [In-Class/Out-of-Class/Partially done].
- Additional Resources: [Link(s)]
- If students finish all work early, have them do [other assignment(s)].

Only put down information relevant for a substitute teacher–or another teacher in general–to know for these plans when you're gone.

___

# 17. Other Additional Duties

## **Short Answer**

You may still have more duties to take care of, and many of them are not teaching-related.

## **Long Answer**

Depending on your assignment, you may have work outside of teaching your assigned subjects. This can include, but is not limited to:

- General school duties
- Proctoring
- Hall duty
- After and before school duty
- Lunch/meal duty
- PIC (person-in-charge) for events
- Chaperone
- Homeroom teacher
- Extra-curriculars
- Field trips
- Community service
- Marketing materials
- Student supervision (outside of typical classroom supervision as a teacher)
- Substitute Teaching (as a teacher)
- Mandatory Reporter

Not every teacher has to do ALL of these, but there's a high chance you'll do at least 1 of these, if not several, during your tenure.

Most of these are self-explanatory (e.g., lunch duty = duties you have to follow during lunch time, etc.), while others aren't as obvious.

**Homeroom teachers** are the primary teachers for specific grade levels–or groups of students–and differ from general subject teachers. The exact duties of a homeroom teacher vary from school to school. It's where some administrative tasks, such as attendance, lunch money, announcements, flyers, and managing supplies, are likely handled. The groups meeting their homeroom teachers are typically at the start or end of the school day. It's not too different from teaching usually. You're also a point of contact for parents, staff, and more for the students assigned to you, and you may need to attend meetings with non-students concerning your students.

**Extracurriculars** are "anything that is not taught in a standard curriculum." These are clubs, athletic groups, organizations, etc. Each of these clubs has at least one adult present amongst all students, acting as the supervisor/organizer and point of contact. For certain activities, like sports, you don't necessarily need a teacher to be a coach; it can be any vetted adult by the school or educational facility, permitting the adult to act as a coach for them. Most of the time, though, teachers from your school or institution are supervisors and contacts for extracurriculars. You employ similar tactics to teaching, but operate outside a strict curriculum, and your goal is to excel in an activity, such as a chess club. The tips you know for managing students apply here, and you're still responsible for students under your care at these extracurriculars.

**Field trips** are part "in the name" and part deceptively simple. If you've ever planned a vacation before and it involves overnight stays in a different area, or flying over to a different state or country, many of the same principles also apply to field trips here. Outside of vacations you may or may not be used to, field trips require a significant amount of time to prepare beforehand because you need some things before you even go on a trip.

- The funding necessary for the trip
- Appropriate accommodations
- An explicit list of students going on the trip
- Permission forms signed by parents/students
- Waivers (if applicable) signed by parents/students
- Securing a means of travel
- Securing a means of staying overnight (if applicable)
- Convincing the principal and other administration to approve it
- Adjusting the curriculum to accommodate the field trip

Other factors depend on your exact situation, such as what is allowed by the administration, who can and cannot go on trips, and more, which I won't list here. Field trips may occur as a part of club or extra-curricular activities, but also in general subject classrooms. The biggest blocker to field trips is acquiring permission from parents/guardians (unless the student is of age to sign the forms in place of parents/guardians), as well as administration. Other likely blockers are insufficient funds or a lack of transportation.

In the United States, means of transportation are interesting–and surprisingly strict–for teachers. **In secondary and primary education (high school and below), you may not, as a teacher, operate a vehicle with any students inside of it.** There are rare exceptions where you *can* do this. Still, it requires both paperwork and legal liability coverage, which you're highly unlikely to have, and, even if you do have it, it's not worth risking the litigation over unless it is a dire emergency. You are in constant communication with a principal and communicate with a parent during transportation.

What this vehicle restriction means for you, as a teacher, is that all methods of transportation need to be covered by vetted adults, like student parents with appropriate background checks, or a paid-out transportation service like a shuttle or bus. Travel includes land, sea, and air, as well as space in the far future.

**Proctoring** is when you're observing students taking a test and is typically done through state standard tests, college admission tests like ACT and SAT, advanced tests like AP and IB, online proctor testing, and traditional room/exam hall testing. For traditional testing and tests for subjects in your classroom, you define how you monitor student activity, what is allowed, and what is not allowed. For tests used to transfer into higher education or state assessments, expect a proctor guide on how to monitor students taking the test, including the test schedule, time allotments, break schedules, and the arrangement of students and desks in the testing area. Proctoring isn't too difficult, from personal experience, but it requires vigilance and monitoring throughout the entire testing period.

**Substitute teaching** can be assumed by a separate substitute teacher, or by a current teacher at the institution doing it for you for a time. Sometimes, as a current teacher, you may need to substitute for another teacher at the exact location. The teacher you're subbing in for should have left you a plan, if not emergency plans at least, for you to follow. As long as you follow those plans, you're generally in good shape. If there are *no* plans left at all, refer to the support staff in the area, if present, for assistance.

# 18. Maintaining Your Health

## **Short Answer**

You are human, so you have human needs. For many, teaching is a job and not their life.

I view two ways to approach teaching and instruction: as a job and as a career.
- Job: you go in before contract hours, do your role to the best of your ability, then leave after contract hours. 
    - I.e., you leave work at work, take time off when needed, and invest in other passions.
- Career: you see teaching and instruction as a passion and dedicate yourself continously to improvement, and helping outside of a work setting, when able.

Both ways are valid and don't necessarily correlate to teaching ability or how much you enjoy the job; you can have amazing and passionate teachers and instructors with either perspective. One may switch between viewing teaching as a job vs career over time too. 

With either way, though, be careful not to get taken advantage of and know when to set boundaries.

***Disclaimer: All items in this section are not medical advice.***

## **Long Answer**

Many teachers are likely to work outside of their contract hours; the hours of the day you're "supposed" to be at a school performing duties. For first-year teachers, it's nearly inevitable because you're designing everything from scratch. If not going from scratch, then you're spending more time figuring out how the systems work. For more experienced teachers, the amount of time outside of work you get back gradually increases because you can do things faster and require less rigorous setup for your classes. You've had *years* to fine-tune everything and build up a pool of resources to quickly draw from.

### A list of things to consider

Here are things to watch out for that I've personally had to be mindful of. Some parts are repeats of what I said before, but if I'm repeating it, *it's for a good reason*:

- Get enough sleep.
- Whenever possible, do NOT work outside of your contracted hours.
  - If you need to volunteer for things, do not volunteer for too many things all at once.
- If you can get around a third to a fourth (6 to 8 hours) of time to yourself–and family, if you have one–each day, that would be ideal.
  - Your hours are about 8 hours each day, and potentially up to 1 to 2 hours of travel each working day.
- Make grading easy for you and automate it if you can.
- Do NOT sacrifice your health for a job. If it is dangerous to do, avoid it if able.
- You will have good days and you will have bad days. Sometimes the bad days will ruin your entire day, and the best course of action is to try and focus on something else–outside of work–on that day.
- Chances are, in your first year in a teaching environment, you'll get sick because you're exposed to more germs and bacteria.
  - Stay up to date with shots & vaccines.
  - Reduce exposure when you can.
  - Wash hands before leaving the workplace.
  - Have hand sanitizer somewhere within the room or area you're working in. Don't always use it though; sometimes hot water + soap works better.
  - Have a FAK (First Aid Kit) handy in case of minor emergencies.
  - Keep disinfectant/sanitising wipes in the area you're working in as well.
- Exercise, even a little bit, will help keep you in moderate shape. Even walking is fine.
- Since COVID-19, wearing a mask won't be seen as weird as it was in the past, and you can use it if you're in higher-risk health environments. If multiple students are coughing, then definitely wear a mask even in everyday environments.
- Ensure you're meeting nutritional needs, such as vitamin and calorie intake.
- Manage stress.

If you're in a position where you also happen to be teaching basic health (not advanced health and medicine; leave that to health professionals like nurses, doctors, and dieticians), you can look into sources such as the CDC, NIH, and nutrition.gov as starting references.

### A Quick Life Lesson From An Unexpected Source

There's an exchange between Dr. Cox and J.D. from the TV show *Scrubs* in the episode "My Lunch" that sticks in my head more than I care to admit. 

I'll post the entire exchange below; **[transcript sourced from IMDB](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0796524/quotes/?item=qt5357194&ref_=ext_shr_lnk)**.

*(Transcript Start)*

> J.D.: You know what I was thinking the whole time I was having lunch with Jill?

> Dr. Cox: What's that?

> J.D.: "God, this girl's annoying."

> Dr. Cox: I saw her in that supermarket, too, but I'm not torturing myself. Would you like to know why?

> J.D.: Why?

> Dr. Cox: Because she didn't come to the hospital looking for help. We just randomly bumped into her out here in the world. Don't get me wrong, if a guy gets shot or if he has a heart attack and I am physically the closest doctor to him, I will intervene. Shy of that, you can't. You just can't. It's too much to ask of yourself.

> J.D.: [half-heartedly] Okay. I hear you.

> Dr. Cox: No. You don't. Once you start blaming yourself for deaths that aren't your fault, my friend, that's a slippery slope that you can't come back from. And trust me, I've seen it ruin a hell of a lot of good doctors. And I will not let it happen to you.

> J.D.: [narration] And because he said that... I knew it wouldn't.

*(Transcript End)*

Fortunately, as teachers, you don't have to worry about causing deaths unless you're in a field where that is a real possibility. 

Instead, please take a moment to consider that scene in a teaching context. Two things to change:
1. Replace deaths with failing/failure, patients with students, and doctors with teachers. 
2. Replace "gets shot" and heart attack with a desire to learn. 

You shouldn't always be blaming yourself for your students' failure. Even with all the aid you provide to a student, that student may still fail, and there's a point where you're going to have to accept that. You've done your duty in the classroom, school, or learning environment, and that is your primary duty: properly teaching during your professional working hours. 

It may take less than a month, or a year, or even your entire teaching career before this happens. Still, there's always the chance it will happen to you, and you have to overcome that challenge or else have it eat away at you the rest of your life.

Like the scene above, now that I told you about it, hopefully, you won't get affected by it as much.

### An Isolating Profession

Another thing about being a teacher is that it's an isolating profession. This sounds odd at first, because a teacher is interacting with many other human beings a lot. Still, many teachers are working alone most of the time.

In a teaching setting, your brain is processing multiple things at once:
- The content you're teaching
- How to explain the content to students to be best understood
- The possible dozen to 100+ social dynamics happening in the background, where any one of them can escalate into an issue
- Checking the entries and exits for any sudden visitors, which means potential interruptions to the class
- Scanning the room occasionally for emergencies which have an ever-present chance to occur; exponentially compounded as student count increases
- Maintaining a "high alert" state the entire class period, multiple hours at once, or even the entire day without pause or rest
- How to not undergo a sensory overload during the day

These occurrences aren't exclusive to teachers. High-stress, high-stakes roles such as firefighters, police, military, doctors, air traffic controllers, CEOs, and nurses may have similar experiences and situations, though across vastly different contexts, scenarios, and conflicts. Your actions may not affect whether someone lives or dies, but the environment you're in places a higher amount of stress than you may first expect.

To break it down mathematically, your brain is usually at 90-95% active utilization and 5-10% downtime at any given time on a workday. What this lack of downtime means is you'll want to bottle up many emotions and suppress them, because you often don't have the luxury to sort them out midway with a break. When a break does occur, you'll want to vent out and decompress as soon as possible. Even then, your current location at work may not be ideal for decompressing, so you'll have to wait for a later opportunity again, likely at the end of the day when you're back home from work.

Venting and decompressing vary among individuals. It can be done through body language, verbally venting frustrations, relaxing peacefully, or any combination of these three and more. Maybe it takes 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or even an hour before you mentally reach a "normal" state and de-escalate from a "high alert" state.

**Keep in mind, these mental states and decompression processes are surprisingly normal.** I have gone through situations like these too. Despite saying that, be mindful that your decompression or venting doesn't negatively harm or abuse other human beings, their property, and yourself. If it reaches that point or feels it's reaching that point, that's when it's gone too far, and you'll want professional help (e.g., therapists, doctors, etc.) to get through those hardships.

___

# 19. Money and Budget Management

## **Short Answer**

**Money is a resource you may not have enough of when teaching. Be careful spending it.**

## **Long Answer**

While I did talk about monetary blockers briefly before, I'm creating a separate section because money permeates every facet of teaching, either directly or indirectly. Your wage is also affected by money.

**If teachers are managers, then each class you're teaching is a project you're overseeing.**

- Students are employees doing the tasks by learning and showing proof they learned properly.
- You have an assigned budget for supplies, equipment, and materials–mainly provided by the school, PTO/PTA, or investments.
- You're organizing the workload distribution (units and topics in your subjects taught) through a set period, with a strict deadline.
- You have to make sure students are doing the work and not causing excessive issues amongst each other. There is behavior management involved.

Teachers are managers, it turns out. Another role you have, though it is not explicitly said too often, is managing money. If you don't have money or spend it all unwisely, you may not have the supplies to teach. Unlike managers, though, you typically don't deal with all the nuances of budgets and money; that's up to the principal(s) at your institution.

### Covering The Budget
Now then, your "budget," which comes in different names, such as PTO allowance, learning budget, classroom budget, and more. For consistency's sake, I'll refer to it as "learning budget" going forward. Unless you're teaching outside of a normal educational institution, your spending limit is defined by someone else, like your principal, and not you. Additionally, the items permitted to be covered by that learning budget are not up to you; instead, this is defined by your federal government (namely, the IRS), the principal, and/or any organization providing the funds. Even if you're not subject to principal control, you are very much subject to IRS control. If you're part of a non-profit, you also have stricter requirements on what can and cannot be paid for *in general*.

This amount varies wildly across institutions, but I've seen ranges from a couple hundred USD ($200) to several thousand USD ($3000+), *per year*, granted as a learning budget for a teacher. For some schools, this may come from a source known as a parent-teacher association (PTA) or a parent-teacher organization (PTO) that provides grants and approves purchases and materials teachers buy. From personal experience, as long as you're getting only supplies they'll cover–or able to get them to cover–you won't have much difficulty getting it covered. Suppose you're still low on budgetary needs. In that case, you can also look into third-party organizations, such as Adopt a Classroom. I won't discuss those in depth because of their varied nature.

Outside of groups like PTA and PTO, state and federal budgets also affect your learning budget–and by extension, your school budget. At the state and federal level, they define an overall budget, and it goes through the funnel of districts and principals to finalize the budget each teacher, including you, gets for the classroom. A school or institution may provide complementary currency, virtual currency, digital assets, or sectoral currency, such as online currency valid to use only on Teachers Pay Teachers.

Typically, where a teacher puts the learning budget and funds into are some of the following. There are significantly more examples, but these come to mind first:

- General classroom supplies
- Books
- Lab equipment
- Furniture and decorations
- Software Licenses
- Multimedia equipment
- Computers/Laptops
- Office supplies
- Paper
- Online learning materials

Because this is a manual on teaching and not budgeting, I'll avoid going into details on how to manage the budget. As long as you don't carelessly spend money and realize the budget needs to last for the entire teaching period, you should be OK. Generally speaking, when buying things, you want to look for the following:

- Any deals or significant savings
- Items that you don't immediately need, you can get in a timely fashion
  - This is called having "lead time" and is the time between order placement and order delivery
- Items you can plan out in advance to purchase
- Items not easily obtainable without purchasing them
- Things that are safe (or safe enough for science) in a teaching environment

### Putting It Into Practice (Budgeting for Newbies)

**If you're not sure how much you should spend, forget about whatever learning budget you have and pretend you have only 100 USD (United States dollars).** It's probable you can have the essentials and basic supplies you need for a classroom with that amount, like pencils and paper. 
- The only exception to this 100 USD limit right now is for any ONE item you need for teaching–not the physical classroom–that is >=100 USD.
- Keep in mind that these items you buy can also be just for you, the teacher, and not for student use.
- If the school/facility provides something you need in general, you could get away with not buying your version and save money.
  - E.g., don't get a laminator machine or a printer if your facility already has a working one. 
- You also don't need to spend all 100 USD. If you get everything you need with less money spent, that's fine and saves you more money.

As an aside: use a credit card instead of a debit card if able. You'll have more protection in case of fraud or another adverse event happens, plus get benefits when used correctly (**[Further reading from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/050214/credit-vs-debit-cards-which-better.asp)**).

Once the first 100 USD is spent, stop and ask yourself if there are any other essentials you need. 

Set aside some money to replenish essential goods throughout the year. Then, you can use the rest of your budget for other items and goods you may need, as well as lower-priority items. 
- I'd set aside 50% of my budget at first, but your mileage may vary 

If it's near the end of the year and you need to reach net zero–where you spend up your entire budget on purpose–then you can tap more into your savings to purchase teaching and classroom supplies for both this teaching period and future teaching periods.

**Your learning budget is supposed to last the entire teaching period, whether that is a year, semester, or otherwise.** If you spend it all at once, then you're in for a bad time. Also, remember to keep your receipts and ensure items in your budget are reimbursed whenever possible, so you don't pay out-of-pocket if you don't need to. You can get your school, sponsors, and grants to get you the funds as long as you can show it's necessary for teaching and the funds are there.

**Remember: Never pay out-of-pocket unless necessary, and don't go above your allotted learning budget whenever possible.** You don't have to spend much money for a good teaching experience; only as much as you need.

# 20. The Use of AI

## **Short Answer**

**Don't use AI for learning if students do not know how to use AI safely and adequately.** It is still a tool you, as a teacher, should learn about, plan for, and utilize because it is not going away any time soon.

## **Long Answer**

**Here are some questions for you:**

- "When should you use AI?"
- "When should you NOT use AI?"
- "How do you know what AI generates is true and correct?"
- "When can you use a simpler method, like linear regression, instead of an advanced AI tool to solve your problem?"
- "At what point will AI fail to solve your problem(s)?"
- "Will using AI benefit your instruction?"

**If you cannot confidently answer these questions, that's OK, but I will tell you that you shouldn't use AI yet. If you do have solid answers, that's good.**

For those with a math or science background unsure where to start or new to AI, I'll point a finger at [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) on AI/LLMs.

For those with less technical backgrounds, here's what I'll say AI is, in simple terms:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) takes data and information, tries to find patterns and relationships within it based on prior knowledge (i.e., what it's trained on), and generates results from its findings.

Before continuing, I'll emphasize important points about AI that mirror my views on it.

- No matter what you use AI (and LLMs) for, you are ultimately responsible for it. If you use AI, you MUST verify its output is correct; otherwise, you'll be in trouble.
- Don't feed it sensitive data, like medical records, legal documents, credit card statements, and/or confidential information in general. It can use, log, and transmit that data into a public space, and put you at risk of fraud, theft, and more.
- Sometimes, doing it manually is faster than getting AI to do it for you.
- Even with all of its advantages, the use of AI can remove learning opportunities and retention of information.
- Your students WILL use AI if able to. Make plans for its use.
- You don't always have to incorporate AI into a classroom. It's a tool, like any other.

That said, AI is a complicated topic. The velocity, volume, value, variety, and veracity of AI development increase year after year, month after month, and much of what I say could be invalidated within less than a year, if not 5 years. 

According to Simon Willison, on his Weblog in June 2025, the past six months (December 2024 to June 2025) *alone* there were multiple advancements in AI, including but not limited to:

- Amazon's Nova models
- DeepSeek V3
- Meta's Llama 3 Series
- Mistral Small 3
- Many, *many* more

**I find teachers fall under three categories of AI usage:**

- No AI use to Casual use (Checking out ChatGPT infrequently)
- Casual use to Moderate use (Infrequent to regular use of ChatGPT, Deepseek, OpenAI)
- Moderate use to Heavy use (Using multiple AI models / LLMs and/or teaching on it)

Most teachers I've seen are in the first two categories. The third category I've seen is mainly teachers in engineering, computer science, or software development, and the rare teacher outside of those fields. Despite these initial observations, I'm betting people will become increasingly familiar with AI and more AI products will enter their workflow, whether by choice or not.

What is not likely to change, though, is where AI applies to teaching and students specifically. Here are some examples I've seen and would categorize below.

**AI Okay**
- Repeating redundant tasks usually done manually (e.g., writing "1" in the top right, multiple times, on hundreds of papers.)

# 21. Design Systems and EdTech

## **Short Answer**

Everyone is a designer. Not everyone is a good designer, however.

Understanding design systems translates directly into skills across multiple fields and helps with templating, creating reusable components and materials, and making it easy to change things.

Don't fall in love with your work, because there's a high chance you will change it later.

## **Long Answer**

Considering all the other topics and themes in the book, some readers think I'm pulling a Kansas City Shuffle on them. To that I say: you're right, but also wrong. 

I've lived in Kansas City and can tell you about gas station barbecue, amongst other things, no problem. I'll also tell you I'm not talking about Kansas City, MO, but instead Kansas City, KS.

Moving on!

### The Weird Complexity of Design Systems

Per Chad Bergman on Figma’s blog (**[Further Reading](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-systems-101-what-is-a-design-system/#what-exactly-is-a-design-system)**):

> A design system is a set of building blocks and standards that help keep the look and feel of products and experiences consistent.

For those with less artistic backgrounds or lacking design skills, don't worry. You don't need to become a design expert to teach, instruct, or present, but I will ask you to see what a design system is and what it tries to accomplish.

If you've ever played with Legos, used power tools for construction, or questioned why you keep losing the 10mm socket for bolts and nuts used across various products, you're dealing with something akin to a design system.

Done correctly, **a design system accomplishes several goals**:
- A single source of truth
- Contains standards, rules, styles, etc., that you can look up and follow
- Collection of libraries hosting your building blocks
- Consistency across all your products and work
- Redundancy and time spent designing reduced
- Higher ease of access to newer and experienced personnel

**Design systems are utilized in three ways: Adopt, Adapt, Create.**

**Adopting takes a design system and adds it into your current system(s) without changes.** It doesn't always replace an existing system, but it does have to go into an existing workflow.
- To give an example, you're taking a cake recipe you found in a book and introducing it as a new item, as is, without changing it. 

**Adapting takes a design system and changes parts and pieces to fit it into existing system(s).**
- Continuing from the cake example: you find a cake recipe in a book and follow its steps closely, but you need to substitute the flour for a gluten-free alternative to satisfy the needs of employees, users, etc.

**Creating borrows from no design system and creates a new system from scratch.** You can still reference other design systems to create your own. You're not taking any existing products and modifying them. You're going from 0-100 (or close to it).
- You looked around the Internet for cake recipes, but didn't see any you liked. Making an educated guess (and perhaps doing research/testing), you create your cake recipe, deciding its process and ingredients, to sell to consumers.

Adopting, adapting, and creating each have their benefits and drawbacks. This isn't limited to just design systems; it can go across various processes and software you use, too. Adopting is the least costly (usually), but offers less customization, while creating is the most expensive, whether in time and/or money, but offers high customization to stand out more. Adapting is somewhere in between adopting and creating, depending on the extent and nature of the adaptation from design systems.

If you're unsure whether to adopt, adapt, or create, consider the amount of creative freedom or control you need over your system. Adopting suits interests best when you don't need to make many edits, but creating suits interests best when you're expecting to make multiple customizations and adjustments over time.

### How Design Systems Relate to Teaching

Think of design systems as curricula. Let me draw some parallels below:
- Both have well-defined standards to follow
- Both contain (hopefully) a library of resources to create your materials and reproduce them
- Both have ways to edit foundational elements and components to provide a service
- Both offer options for templates, patterns, components, and tokens
- Both are organized into a clear hierarchy of topics/components
- Both offer ways for handling different types of media and information delivery
- Both permit edits from multiple people, which applies to all materials within the system
- Both define a shared vocabulary that people from diverse backgrounds can interpret
- Both stand the test of time and persist across multiple periods

**If you're starting fresh, here are some pointers. This applies to both curricula and design systems:**
- Do whatever makes the most sense for your use case(s) and the people using your design system or curriculum. 
  - If it doesn't make sense, then no one's going to want to stick with it
- Look up actual design systems. Some examples are linked below:
  - [https://designsystem.digital.gov/](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)
  - [https://atlassian.design/](https://atlassian.design/)
  - [https://m3.material.io/](https://m3.material.io/)
  - [https://developer.apple.com/design/](https://developer.apple.com/design/)
  - [https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)
  - [https://www.designsystems.com/](https://www.designsystems.com/)
- If you want to make good designs, you have to start designing.
- Learn not to fall in love with your work, because high chances are you will change it later.
  - Sometimes it's also your boss or consumers making you change it.

### What about EdTech?

Not much to say about it. 

Many of the same rules and concepts you find in design systems, you can apply to physical work and educational technology, all the same. 

Some software you use will look "good" and function properly, while other software will not look good and will not function properly. Over time, the overall quality of software and technology options will increase drastically. Still, there will always be gaps and deficiencies.

Sometimes you're forced to use a particular software, or a suite of software, to accomplish your goal. Software is a tool to achieve a task or solve a problem you have, and you'll be better off knowing how to use a tool than not knowing how to use a tool. With tools, however, you won't get better with them unless you use them.

### I don't have much design experience though!

Two things before you panic.
1. You can "design" in PowerPoint, Excel, and Microsoft Word or their equivalents in Google Documents, Sheets, and Slides as well. If you need advanced design programs, look into tools like Figma, ProtoPie, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch.
2. You're likely focused more on content, the delivery of content, and the management of students rather than design anyway. Learn just enough to get by and supplement your teaching.

Some general rules of thumb you can quickly apply come from personal experience as well as reading through *Refactoring UI* by Wathan and Schoger.

*This is still a decently sized list.* 

- Start with simple designs and get them functional first before you add complexity
- It's easier to start with more white space and remove it rather than start with too little white space and add it
- Limit your choices, like number of colors, font sizes, adjustments, etc., early on to avoid analysis paralysis later on
- Emphasize, whether by increasing the size, bolding text, etc., the information that a student will look for
- Ideal line height (sometimes called "Line Spacing") is inversely proportional to font size
- Text needs sufficient contrast between itself and the background it's on to be readable
- 5 random colors don't make a good design, but 8-10 shades, both lighter and darker, of 5 random colors can make a good design
- For colorblind people, it's easier to tell by lightness (light/dark) rather than color
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- Many greys you see in the world aren't true greys; they are grey with another color saturated/mixed in
- For making lighter and darker shades of colors, increase the saturation as well, or it looks "washed out"
- HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) is easier to work with compared to RGB and Hex, in my opinion, but many people still work with Hex
- Make paragraphs stay between 45 and 75 characters per line of text when able
- For fonts, stick with a neutral sans-serif, like Roboto, Helvetica Neue, or even Arial if you want

# 22. Action Plan: Day 1 

*Notice: This setup is designed for a year-long (or semester-long) class session taking place at a physical location for primary or secondary education.*

The very first day of a classroom setting. Depending on your timeframe, like if your entire curriculum is one day long, what you need prepared may change.

*Ideally,* you'll have at least a few days to a week of preparation time to get ready for the class. If not, well, get what you can.

**Here are some things I'd like to have (and/or know) by day 1.** I'm focusing on the bare essentials over "nice to haves" to balance preparedness with minimal cost and effort, plus the ability to address many situations:
- Facility access, like keys and scannable ID badge
- Parking space, if you travel by car
- Designated location(s) to teach on campus
- Building layout map
- A list of immediate work contacts, like principal, support staff, other teachers in the department, etc.
- A syllabus
- Basic supplies
  - Whiteboard markers, pencils, pens, paper, sticky notes, rulers, etc.
- Lesson plan for the day and/or first week
- List of standards and objectives for your class(es) taught
- Any additional rules and student expectations
- Seating assignments (if applicable)
- Cleaning supplies
- Desks and chairs (if applicable)
- Utilities functioning in the classroom, such as sinks, fridges, ovens, HVAC, etc.
  - If not, you can submit requests to fix ASAP
- School and/or class schedule
- List of students for the class(es)
- Your account information for computers, payroll systems, work emails, etc.
- Specialist supplies (if applicable)
  - E.g., a class on medicine may need medical supplies ready on day 1
- First Aid Kit (FAK)
  - Trauma kit also fine, but that's overkill for many classrooms unless severe and higher damage is possible
- Something to carry your supplies around
  - Backpack, binder, etc.
- Locations of critical areas on campus, such as the teacher lounge, fridge to store your food, bathrooms, and the front office + nurse/health room
- List of software and other tools you need for class on the first day
- N95 and KN95 (or higher grade) masks

This is an extensive list, but think of it like climbing a plateau. It is steep initially, but once you reach the top, it flattens out and is easier to traverse. 

You may be climbing up a short plateau as well, and not even need all these items. You may need even more than what's listed here. The situation depends on a case-by-case basis.

There are some parts I'll go more into depth on, which aren't as obvious.

### Syllabus
A syllabus is essential information for the student to know about in your class. Depending on student demographics, this can be either simple or more complex in design.

This may include, but is not limited to:
- Learning objectives
- Goals
- Grades/grading distribution
- Late work policies
- Absences
- Exam schedule
- Course content
- Classroom schedule & meeting times
- Required materials and account information
  - For physical textbooks, online programs, etc.
- Information on the course
- Payment methods, payment plans, and monetary costs (if applicable)
- Classroom rules and expectations

By default, a syllabus is not a legal document or contract as it doesn't require the signatures of students or teachers. You should, however, ensure it is readily accessible and understood by students.

### Lesson Plan
Lesson plans are a written record of what you're teaching. Depending on class intensity, your day 1 may go over only the syllabus and expectations, with a possible activity, or straight into the material.

In either case, this is a guide for you, the teacher, so you know what you're teaching and stay on track. You'll also want a lesson plan written to show "proof of learning" in case a student comes back to claim something was not taught.

### Additional Rules and Expectations
Sometimes extra rules and expectations are established outside of the syllabus, depending on your situation, which aren't related to what or how you're teaching, but other factors, like location or software you're using.

In both the syllabus and outside of the syllabus, the biggest things to keep in mind are:
- You can enforce the rule(s) you make
- The rules are legal
- They fit your management style, when possible, so it is easier for you to enforce and follow through on

### First Aid Kit (FAK)

*Disclaimer: This is NOT medical advice. Seek a medical professional or certified medical staff for further medical questions.*

I've been pleasantly surprised by how often a FAK was necessary–even for minor injuries and the occasional request for a bandage.

Keep in mind, as a teacher, you may not administer drugs to students. There are a few cases where it is OK. Still, they are explicitly defined, narrow exceptions with specific procedures to follow. Unless you can verify and prove you fit one of these exceptions, do NOT administer drugs.

Vaseline, Neosporin, and similar items also contain active drug ingredients, which means you're still administering drugs to students and risking legal issues. This also includes lotions, topical creams, and other oral medicines.

You may think Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Advil, etc., are OK to administer, but they are not. It still falls under narrow exceptions; if you and the situation don't apply under an exception, don't give it to students. Hospitals and medical facilities also track their use through acetaminophen ("Tylenol") levels in blood because of how easy it is to acquire and overdose on it.
- **An overdose, even accidental, is a medical emergency that you do not want to cause or be responsible for, and can lead to death.**

You may also consider a bottle of peppermint concentrate/oil/extract. You can safely avoid that because the likelihood you deal with a foul smell on the level of putrescine or cadaverine in your work setting is extremely low.

Some items are in a grey area, such as disinfectants and antiseptic wipes. For those, confirm with a principal, administrator, and/or nursing staff first before using, and also confirm the cases where it can be used.

**Some items I found are OK in a first aid kit (FAK) are the following, as they aren't administering drugs:**
- Bandages
- Scissors
- Tweezers
- Disposable Nitrile Gloves
- Blanket
- Cold Compress
- Tape
- Gauze

There are several other items you could use that don't administer drugs, but they either: 
- Are unlikely to be needed in everyday situations
- Don't administer drugs, but have specific procedures involved not to cause life-threatening harm instead (e.g, tourniquets).

# 23. Action Plan: Week 1

After the first day, it gets easier. It does. The next wall, however, is getting through week 1 and having everything you need by the end of it done or close to done. 

This week is difficult precisely because everything is still "new," and you may need to spend much time outside work now to save time later. It's like interest and principal on a loan; if you pay extra money now towards the principal on top of the interest, the average interest across all future pay periods decreases.

**Here are some things I'd want sorted, or just about done, by week 1:**

- A document, table, database, etc., with all relevant links to legal organizations, software I'll need to use, resources I'll need for references and supplies, and more.
  - You can update this over time, but get the majority done in week 1.
- Student seating assignments (if applicable).
- Lesson plans for next week.
- Knowing how to use the grading system.
- Templates for assignments, quizzes, projects, labs, and tests.
- Ideas for how to approach the unit(s) and topic(s) you're covering (see "Agile Teaching Framework" if confused).
- Any software and account issues sorted with students and you, the teacher.
- Student contact information is stored and organized.
- Outstanding payments from students collected (if applicable).
  - If still outstanding, send gentle reminders via email or other contact methods.

Week 1 is where you're setting up your teaching database of information; a place where you can easily access and search for information. This involves cleaning and sorting things first before they're usable, so your first week is OK to sacrifice free time to get your ducks in a row.

### Lesson Plans (Post Day 1)

After day 1, your principal, or another administrator if not the principal, may have expectations for how much–or how little–to include in your lesson plans. General advice is to follow whatever the principal or your boss tells you, to avoid trouble. 

**If you don't have a "boss," though, you'll want to check for questions like these:**

- What are the learning objectives?
- What materials are needed, if any?
- What part(s) of the topics are covered today?
- What homework, if any, is assigned?
- What goals am I trying to reach today?
- How long will it take to get through the topic(s)?
- Can I access and utilize the resources needed for the lesson at this time?

If you can answer those questions, you're doing OK. Your lesson plan can be short or long, so long as it meets your objectives and fits within your deadlines.

### Templates (Assignments, Tests, etc.)

Templates are great, and they save you time. Instead of writing assignments from scratch every time, you can create one master template for each type of work. A template includes static fields where students write information, such as answers and names, and includes dynamic fields where you replace or edit information, such as directions, questions, images, visuals, and more.

After the templating stage, you've effectively cut the time to make every new assignment afterwards in half, thanks to the power of copy and paste! A large portion of time now goes to creating the content going into each copy of your template, but that becomes your focus, and you can make it higher quality now.

**Again, templates are great. If you can use a template or make one, do it.** 
- There are cases where you shouldn't use a template, but they are rare and far in between. You can also create templates for your lesson plans.

___

# 24. Action Plan: Month 1

At about Month 1, you should have your bearings in the classroom and how you prefer teaching. You have an idea of what kind of activities to do, how to present lectures, administer tests and quizzes, etc. You'll also have formed educated guesses and judgments, whether consciously or unconsciously, about many of your students and how they may fare in your class.

At this point, you're going to focus on finer details and further refine all of your processes–not just how you're teaching. Remember, a teacher is a combination of many roles all in one (except therapist). Put another way, you're going to figure out how to develop yourself professionally. As much as I can help you out with this guide, it only sticks if you put it into practice yourself.

**Here are some questions I would consider at this timeframe, if I have not already:**
- Are there resources I haven't considered yet that I should look into for teaching?
- Is there a more efficient way to do [thing/process/method]?
- Is there a more effective way to do [thing/process/method]?
- Are students behaving as I want them to?
- If not, what can I do to make them behave better in class?
- Can I still make curriculum deadlines?
- How do I better plan for unexpected events?
- How can I make this topic easier to learn / more accessible?
- Is there a way of learning I haven't explored yet?
- Are there accommodations for students I should provide that I have not already given?
- Are there any other problems I need to provide a fix for?

After the first month, you should be closer to a routine schedule rather than playing catch-up, so you have time to reflect and self-realize.

For first-year teachers, your main goal is survival. When you have completed everything you need or meet the minimum effectiveness requirements, then you can expand from there.

### A Note on Effectiveness vs Efficiency

During your self-reflection period, these terms may come into mind.

Effectiveness and efficiency are two terms used in similar contexts and fields, but they are not interchangeable. It doesn't take a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering or a Six Sigma black belt to tell you that. I'll spare you a thesis and describe it in a few different ways.

1. An effective but inefficient solution solves a problem, whereas an ineffective but efficient solution does not solve a problem.
2. Once you learn that everything is a system of some kind and see what makes effective and efficient systems, you can't help but see inefficiencies in things you couldn't before.
3. Per Peter Drucker in *The Effective Executive*: “Efficiency is doing things right. Effectiveness is doing the right thing."

___

# 25. Case Study: Communication Lesson

*Notice: You can copy and modify this template. This is based on an activity I did for my students in Science classes.*

### Objective 
Students will examine a case study and learn how to communicate and present to a larger audience. The assignment will test their ability to identify why the presentation is effective, which elements contributed to its effectiveness, and what made the topic particularly effective.

### Time Distribution
**~50 minutes total**
- ~5 minutes for Teacher prep and administrative tasks beforehand
- 15 minutes for video
- 15 minutes to complete questions
- 15 minutes for classroom discussion over answers and presentation
- Any remaining free time is dedicated to further discussion

### Resource(s)
Steve Jobs Introduced iPhone in 2007
(Posted on YouTube by John Schroter):
[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrJzXM7a6o](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrJzXM7a6o) 

### Accommodations
- For hearing impairments, turn on closed captions (CC) in the video.

  - If there is an interpreter present with the student(s), permit the interpreter to assist with the questions and follow along with the classwide discussion.
- For sight impairments, base grading on their level of active participation and how well they answer questions you ask. 
Avoid asking them questions dealing with heavy visual elements.
- For physical impairments, have seating available for these students if not already available.
- For writing impairments, you may permit them an electronic copy of the assignment to type their answers on. They're still required to participate in discussion, however.

### Standards
- [Teacher defined; may vary depending on grade level, subject, etc]

### Questions
*Student Notice: For all questions, assume answers need to be in complete sentences unless stated otherwise.*

- What elements were integral to Steve Jobs' presentation? List six different elements you spotted in the video—no complete sentences needed.

- What did you notice about the way he spoke and the types of words and sentences he used?

- On his presentation slides, what was the maximum number of words seen on any slide?

- How were visuals used to accompany spoken and written words?

- At what points were the audience the most excited? Why were they excited?

- What features of the iPhone were you the most interested in during his presentation? Why were you interested in those?

- **Extra Credit:** What feature received a low amount of applause, but is still an essential feature of the iPhone? Why?

### PAUSE

**When done, wait for the teacher to signal the start of classroom discussions. If done early, review and refine your answers above.**

### Discussion

**Steps to follow:**
- The teacher provides 5 minutes for students to discuss the answers amongst themselves. 
- After 5 minutes, the teacher provides information about the presentation itself, gradually answering some, if not all, of the questions.
  - This process takes 10 minutes, depending on the number of questions.
- If done early, the teacher may do one of these options:
  - "Free time" for students until class dismissal
  - Ask "improv" questions about the presentation to the class
  - Allow early dismissal (if permitted by principal/school policy)
  - Ask the students how they would make their presentation on a topic of their choice, using the concepts and themes shown in the video.

# 26. Conclusion / Learnings

Teaching is a combination of many different fields in a single profession.

There's also much management involved, and you can continually improve your teaching over time. The beginning may seem complicated and overwhelming, but it gets easier over time to teach subjects, create curricula, and work with people.

There's a plethora of information I skipped over or omitted that you may go through as a teacher or instructor, like Professional Development or "How to handle X kid in Y class," because the finer details vary wildly amongst schools, districts, organizations providing the continuing education, and more. There are also tips and tricks you'll discover as you get real-world, practical experience that a textual manual like this doesn't convey the information well enough until you, well, "experience" it yourself.

Outside of that, thank you for reading, and I hope you came away from this manual with a deeper understanding of the world of teaching.

### You have reached the end! 😃
